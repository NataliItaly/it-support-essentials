              <h4>Five Layers</h4>
              <p>
                To really understand networking, we need to understand all of
                the components involved. We're talking about everything from the
                cables that connect devices to each other to the protocols that
                these devices use to communicate. There are a bunch of models
                that help explain how network devices communicate but in this
                course we'll focus on a five layer model. By the end of this
                lesson, you'll be able to identify and describe each layer and
                what purpose it serves.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/layers-table.jpeg" alt="" />
              <ul>
                >
                <li>
                  Let's start at the bottom of our stack where we have what's
                  known as the
                  <span class="important_word">physical layer</span>. The
                  physical layer is a lot like what it sounds.
                  <b
                    >It represents the physical devices that interconnect
                    computers. This includes the specifications for the
                    networking cables and the connectors that join devices
                    together along with specifications describing how signals
                    are sent over these connections</b
                  >.
                  <img src="image/2/1/physical-layer.jpeg" alt="" />
                </li>
                <li>
                  The second layer in our model is known as the
                  <span class="important_word">data link layer</span>. Some
                  sources will call this layer the network interface or the
                  network access layer. At this layer we introduce our first
                  protocols. While the physical layer is all about cabling,
                  connectors, and sending signals, the
                  <b
                    >data link layer is responsible for defining a common way of
                    interpreting these signals so network devices can
                    communicate</b
                  >. Lots of protocols exist at the data link layer but
                  <b>the most common protocol is known as ethernet</b>. Although
                  wireless technologies are becoming more and more popular.
                  Beyond specifying physical layer attributes, the ethernet
                  standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data
                  to nodes on the same network or link.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The third layer, the
                  <span class="important_word">network layer</span>, is also
                  sometimes called the internet layer. It's
                  <b
                    >this layer that allows different networks to communicate
                    with each other through devices known as routers</b
                  >. A
                  <b
                    >collection of networks connected together through routers
                    is an inter network, the most famous of these being the
                    internet</b
                  >.
                  <p class="important">
                    While the data link layer is responsible for getting data
                    across a single link, the network layer is responsible for
                    getting data delivered across a collection of networks.
                  </p>
                  Think of one of the device on your home network connects with
                  a server on the internet. It's the network layer that helps
                  get the data between these two locations.
                  <b
                    >The most common protocol used at this layer is known as IP
                    or internet protocol. IP is the heart of the internet and
                    most small networks around the world</b
                  >. Network software is usually divided into client and server
                  categories with the client application initiating a request
                  for data and the server software answering the request across
                  the network. A single node may be running multiple client or
                  server applications. So you might run an email program and a
                  web browser. Both client applications on your PC at the same
                  time and your email and web server might both run on the same
                  server. Even so, emails end up in your email application and
                  web pages end up in your web browser.

                </li>
                <li>
                  That's because our next layer, the
                  <span class="important_word">transport layer</span>. While the
                  network layer delivers data between two individual nodes, the
                  <b
                    >transport layer sorts out which client and server programs
                    are supposed to get that data</b
                  >. When you heard about our network layer protocol IP, you may
                  have thought of TCP/IP, which is a pretty common phrase.
                  That's because the
                  <b
                    >protocol most commonly used in the transport layer, is
                    known as TCP or transmission control protocol</b
                  >. While often said together as the phrase TCP/IP, to fully
                  understand and troubleshoot networking issues,
                  <b
                    >it's important to know that they're entirely different
                    protocols serving different purposes</b
                  >. Other transport protocols also use IP to get around
                  including a protocol known as UDP or user data gram protocol.
                  The big difference between the two is that TCP provides
                  mechanisms to ensure that data is reliably delivered while UDP
                  does not. Spoiler alert will cover differences between the TCP
                  and UDP transport protocols in more detail later. For now,
                  <b
                    >it's important to know that the network layer, in our case
                    IP is responsible for getting data from one node to
                    another</b
                  >. Also remember that the transport layer, mostly TCP and UDP
                  is responsible for ensuring that data gets to the right
                  applications running on those nodes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Last but not least, the fifth layer is known as the
                  <span class="important_word">application layer</span>. There
                  are lots of different protocols at this layer and as you might
                  have guessed from the name, they're application specific.
                  <b
                    >Protocols used to allow you to browse the web or send and
                    receive email are some common ones</b
                  >. The protocols that play in the application layer will be
                  most familiar to you since there are ones you probably
                  interacted with directly before even if you didn't realize it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="important">
                You can think of layers like different aspects of a package
                being delivered. The physical layer is the delivery truck and
                the roads. The data link layer is how the delivery trucks get
                from one intersection to the next over and over. The network
                layer identifies which roads need to be taken to get from
                address A to address B. The transport layer ensures that
                delivery driver knows how to knock on your door to tell you your
                package has arrived. And the application layer is the contents
                of the package itself.

              <p>
                In addition to the five layer model we are working with, it’s
                important to note that other models exist. The traditional
                TCP/IP Model only has four layers, as it doesn’t differentiate
                between the physical layer and the data link layer, but is
                otherwise very similar to the one we’ll be working with. The
                most well known other model is the OSI model. It’s the model
                taught by many other networking certificate programs, like Net+
                and Cisco’s many networking certifications. The primary
                difference between our five layer model and the seven layer OSI
                model is that the OSI model abstracts the application layer into
                three layers total.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Cables</h4>
              <p>
                Lots of different cables and network devices can be used to
                allow computers to properly communicate with each other. By the
                end of this lesson, you'll be able to identify and describe
                various networking cables and networking devices. Computer
                networking is a huge part of the day to day role of many IT
                specialists. And knowing how to differentiate different network
                devices will be essential to your success. Let's start with the
                most basic component of a wired network, cables.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Cables are what connect different devices to each other,
                allowing data to be transmitted over them. Most network cables
                used today can be split into two categories, copper and fiber.
                Copper cables are the most common form of networking cable.
                They're made up of multiple pairs of copper wires inside plastic
                insulator.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may already know that computers communicate in binary, which
                people represent with ones and zeros. The sending device
                communicates binary data across these copper wires by changing
                the voltage between two ranges. The system at the receiving end
                is able to interpret these voltage changes as binary ones and
                zeros which can then be translated into different forms of data.
                The most common forms of copper twisted pair cables used in
                networking are Cat5, Cat5e and Cat6 cables. These are all
                shorthand ways of saying category five or category six cables.
                These categories have different physical characteristics like
                the number of twists in the pair of copper wires that result in
                different usable lengths and transfer rates. Cat5 is older and
                has been mostly replaced by Cat5e and Cat6 cables. From the
                outside, they all look about the same and even internally
                they're very similar to the naked eye.
              </p>
              <p>
                The important thing to know is that, differences in how the
                twisted pairs are arranged inside these cables can drastically
                alter how quickly data can be sent across them.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/different-cat-cables.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                And how resistant these signals are to outside interference.
                Cat5e cables have mostly replaced those older Cat5 cables
                because their internals reduce Crosstalk. Crosstalk is when an
                electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another
                wire, so the receiving end isn't able to understand the data
                causing a network error. Higher level protocols have methods for
                detecting missing data and asking for the data a second time.
                But, of course, this takes up more time. The higher quality
                specifications of a Cat5e cable make it less likely that data
                needs to be re transmitted. That means on average you can expect
                more data to be transferred in the same amount of time. Cat6
                cables follow an even more strict specification to avoid
                Crosstalk making those cables more expensive. Cat6 cables can
                transfer data faster and more reliably than Cat5e cables can,
                but because of their internal arrangement, they have a shorter
                maximum distance when used at higher speeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second primary form of networking cable is known as fiber,
                short for fiber optic cables. Fiber cables contain individual
                optical fibers which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the
                width of a human hair. These tubes of glass can transport beams
                of light. Unlike copper, which uses electrical voltages, fiber
                cables use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros of
                the underlying data. Fiber is even sometimes used specifically
                in environments where there's a lot of electromagnetic
                interference from outside sources. Because this can impact data
                being sent across copper wires. Fiber cables can generally
                transport data quicker than copper cables can, but they're much
                more expensive and fragile. Fiber can also transport data over
                much longer distances than copper can without suffering
                potential data loss. Now you know a lot more about the pros and
                cons of fiber cables. But keep in mind, you'll be way more
                likely to run into fiber cables in computer data centers than
                you would in an office or at home.

                Almost every IT specialist will have to interact with these
                sorts of devices on a regular basis. Cables allow you to form
                point to point networking connections.
              </p>

              />
              <p>
                These are networks where only a single device at each end of the
                link exists. Not to knock point to point networking connections
                but they're not super useful in a world with billions of
                computers. Luckily there are network devices that allow for many
                computers to communicate with each other. The most simple of
                these devices is a hub.
              </p>
              <p>
                A hub is a physical layer device that allows for connections
                from many computers at once. All the devices connected to a hub
                will end up talking to all other devices at the same time.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/hub.jpeg" alt="hub example" />
              <p>
                It's up to each system connected to the hub to determine if the
                incoming data was meant for them or to ignore it if it isn't.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/ignore data.jpeg"
                alt="hub to determine if the incoming data was meant for them or to ignore"
              />
              <p>
                This causes a lot of noise on the network and creates what's
                called a collision domain. A collision domain is a network
                segment where only one device can communicate at a time. If
                multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the
                electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each
                other.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/data-collision.jpeg"
                alt="electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other"
              />
              <p>
                This causes these systems to have to wait for a quiet period
                before they try sending their data again. It really slows down
                network communications and is the primary reason hubs are fairly
                rare. They're mostly a historical artifact today.
              </p>
              <p>
                A much more common way of connecting many computers is with a
                more sophisticated device known as a network switch, originally
                known as a switching hub. A switch is very similar to a hub,
                since you can connect many devices to it so they can
                communicate. The difference is that while a hub is a layer one
                or physical layer device, a switch is a layer two or data link
                device.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/hub-switch1.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                This means that a switch can actually inspect the contents of
                the ethernet protocol data being sent around the network,
                determine which system the data is intended for and then only
                send that data to that one system.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/switch.jpeg"
                alt="switch can actually inspect the contents of the ethernet protocol"
              />
              <p>
                This reduces or even completely eliminates the size of collision
                domains on a network. If you guess that this will lead to fewer
                retransmissions and a higher overall throughput, you're right.

              <h4>Router</h4>
              <p>
                Hubs and switches are the primary devices used to connect
                computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN or a
                Local Area Network. But we often want to send or receive data to
                computers on other networks. This is where routers come into
                play.
              </p>
              <p>
                A router, is a device that knows how to forward data between
                independent networks. While a hub is a layer one device and a
                switch is a layer two device. A router operates at layer three,
                a network layer.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/router-network-layer.jpeg"
                alt="router operates network layer"
              />
              Just like a switch can inspect Ethernet data to determine where to
              send things, a router can inspect IP data to determine where to
              send things. Routers store internal tables containing information
              about how to route traffic between lots of different networks all
              over the world. The most common type of router you'll see is one
              for a home network or a small office. These devices generally
              don't have very detailed routing tables. The purpose of these
              routers is mainly just to take traffic originating from inside the
              home or office land and to forward it along to the ISP or Internet
              Service Provider.
              <p></p>
              <img src="image/2/1/router.jpeg" alt="router working" />
              <p>
                Once traffic is at the ISP a way more sophisticated type of
                router takes over. These core routers form the backbone of the
                internet and are directly responsible for how we send and
                receive data all over the internet every single day. Core ISP
                routers don't just handle a lot more traffic than a home or
                small office router. They also have to deal with much more
                complexity in making decisions about where to send traffic. A
                core router usually has many different connections to many other
                routers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Routers share data with each other via a protocol known as BGP
                or Border Gateway Protocol. That lets them learn about the most
                optimal paths to forward traffic. When you open a web browser
                and load it web page, the traffic between computers and the web
                servers could have traveled over dozens of different routers.
                The Internet is incredibly large and complicated, and routers
                are global guides for getting traffic to the right places.

              <h4>Servers and Clients</h4>
              <p>
                All of the network devices you've just learned about exists so
                that computers can communicate with each other, whether they're
                in the same room or thousands of miles apart. We've been calling
                these devices nodes, and we'll keep doing that. But it's also
                important to understand the concepts of servers and clients. The
                simplest way to think of a server is as something that provides
                data to something requesting that data. The thing receiving the
                data is referred to as a client.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/client-server.jpeg"
                alt="client server scheme"
              />
              <p>
                Well, often talk about nodes being servers or clients. The
                reason our definition uses a word as vague as something is
                because it's not just nodes that can be servers or clients.
                Individual computer programs running on the same node can be
                servers and clients to each other too. It's also important to
                call out that most devices aren't purely a server or a client.
                Almost all nodes are both at some point in time, quite the
                multitasking overachievers. That all being said in most network
                topographies, each node is primarily either a server or a
                client. Sometimes we refer to an email server as an email
                server, even though it's itself a client of a DNS server.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/mail-server-client.jpeg"
                alt="email server as an email server"
              />
              <p>
                Why? Because its primary reason for existing is to serve data to
                clients. Likewise, if a desktop machine occasionally acts as a
                server in the sense that it provides data to another computer,
                its primary reason for existing is to fetch data from servers so
                that the user at the computer can do their work. To sum up, a
                server is anything that can provide data to a client, but we
                also use the words to refer to the primary purpose of various
                nodes on our network.

              <h4>Moving Bits Across the Wire</h4>
              <p>
                In some ways, the physical layer of our network stack model is
                the most complex of all. Its main focus is on moving ones and
                zeros from one end of the link to the next. But very complicated
                mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering principles are
                at play to transmit huge volumes of data across tiny wires at
                incredible speeds.

              />
              <p>
                Luckily for us, most of that falls within a different realm.
                With you, an aspiring IT support specialist needs to know about
                the physical layer is much more approachable. By the end of this
                lesson, you should have a solid foundation in aspects of the
                physical layer that will allow you to properly troubleshoot
                networking issues and set up new networks. Let's dive in.
              </p>
              <p>
                The physical layer consists of devices and means of transmitting
                bits across computer networks. A bit is the smallest
                representation of data that a computer can understand. It's a
                one or a zero. These ones and zeros sense across networks at the
                lowest level are what make up the frames and packets of data
                that we'll learn about when we cover the other layers. The
                takeaway is that it doesn't matter whether you're streaming your
                favorite song, emailing your boss, or using an ATM, what you're
                really doing is sending ones and zeros across the physical layer
                of the many different networks between you, and the server
                you're interacting with.
              </p>
              <p>
                A standard copper network cable, once connected to devices on
                both ends, will carry a constant electrical charge. Ones and
                zeros are sent across those network cables through a process
                called modulation. Modulation is a way of varying the voltage of
                this charge moving across the cable.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/1.modulation-line-coding.jpeg"
                alt="modulation"
              />
              <p>
                When used for computer networks, this kind of modulation is more
                specifically known as line coding. It allows devices on either
                end of a link to understand that an electrical charge in a
                certain state is a zero and another state is a one. Through this
                seemingly simple technique, modern networks are capable of
                moving 10 billion ones and zeros across a single network cable
                every second.

              <h4>Twisted Pair Cabling and Duplexing</h4>
              <p>
                The most common type of cabling used for connecting computing
                devices is known as twisted pair. It's called a twisted pair
                cable because it features pairs of copper wires that are twisted
                together. These pairs act as a single conduit for information
                and they're twisted nature helps protect against electromagnetic
                interference and cross-talk from neighboring pairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                A standard Cat six cable has eight wires consisting of four
                twisted pairs inside a single jacket. Exactly how many pairs are
                actually in use depends on the transmission technology being
                used.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/2.cat-6-cables-has-8-wires.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                But in all modern forms of networking, it's important to know
                that these cables allow for duplex communication. Duplex
                communication is the concept that information can flow in both
                directions across the cable. On the flip side, a process called
                simplex communication is unidirectional. The way networking
                cables ensure that duplex communication is possible is by
                reserving one or two pairs for communicating in one direction.
                They then use the other one or two pairs for communicating in
                the other direction. Devices on either side of a networking link
                can both communicate with each other at the exact same time.
                This is known as full duplex.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/full-duplex.jpeg" alt="full duplex" />
              <p>
                If there's something wrong with the connection, you might see a
                network link to grade and report itself as operating as
                half-duplex. Half-duplex means that while communication is
                possible in each direction, only one device can be communicating
                at a time.

                Supplemental Reading for Twisted Pair Ethernet: Crossover Cables
              </h4>
              <h5>Twisted pair Ethernet: Crossover cable</h5>
              <h6>Crossover cables</h6>
              <p>
                Crossover cables may still be in use in older network
                environments. This section provides information for working with
                crossover Ethernet cable for older Enterprise network devices.
                Note that most new Enterprise devices have the ability to detect
                Ethernet connection types and select the correct wires for
                sending and receiving data using Auto Medium Dependent Interface
                Crossover (Auto-MDI/MDIX) technology. The Auto-MDI/MDIX ports
                replace the crossover cable’s function for connecting two
                devices that use the same sending and receiving wires for data
                communications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Crossover cables are used to connect two computing devices
                directly to one another. As an IT Support specialist, you might
                use a short crossover cable to connect an IT administrator
                laptop directly to an Enterprise machine (e.g., server, switch,
                router, hub, etc.). This type of connection is normally used to
                update, repair, and perform other administrative tasks on the
                Enterprise machine. A crossover cable should be connected
                between the Ethernet port/Network Interface Card (NIC) on the IT
                administrative system and the management port of the Enterprise
                machine. This connection is then used to access the operating
                system and/or the management interface of the Enterprise
                machine. Additionally, crossover cables can connect two
                switches, two hubs, or a switch to a hub, as well as two
                routers, two PCs, or a router to a PC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like straight-through cables, crossover cables can also be
                identified by comparing both ends of the cable to one another.
                Crossover cable ends will have different patterns in the color
                order of the twisted pairs. The crossover cable key below
                describes a typical setup for a T-568-A. If the green wires
                appear in pin positions 1 and 2 on one side of the cable, on the
                opposite end of the cable, the green wires will appear in the
                pin positions 3 and 6. The orange wires will appear in positions
                3 and 6 at one end of the cable, crossing over to the 1 and 2
                positions at the opposite end.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the T-568-B scheme, if you see orange wires start at pin
                positions 3 and 6, they should cross over to pin positions 1 and
                2 at the opposite end of the cable. Green wires should start at
                pin positions 1 and 2, crossing over to 3 and 6 at the opposite
                end. This wiring crossover is needed to connect two computers
                that transmit and receive data on the same wires. Blue and brown
                wires do not cross over to different positions in this set-up.

              <p>
                The final steps of how the physical layer works take place at
                the endpoints of our network links. Twisted pair network cables
                are terminated with a plug that takes the individual internal
                wires and exposes them. The most common plug is known as an RJ
                45 or register Jack 45.

              />
              <p>
                It's one of many cable plug specifications, but by far the most
                common in computer networking,. A network cable with an RJ 45
                plug can connect to an RJ 45 network port. Network ports are
                generally directly attached to the devices that make up a
                computer network. Switches would have many network ports because
                their purpose is to connect many devices, but servers and
                desktops usually only have one or two. Your laptop, tablet or
                phone probably don't have any. Most network ports have two small
                L E D s.
              </p>

                class="image_medium"
              />
              <p>
                One is the link light and the other is the activity light. The
                link light will be lit when a cable is properly connected to two
                devices that are both powered on.
              </p>
              <img

                class="image_medium"
              />
              <p>
                The activity light will flash when data is actively transmitted
                across the cable. A long time ago, the flashing of activity
                light corresponded directly to the ones and zeros being sent.
                Today computer networks are so fast that the activity light
                doesn't really communicate much other than if there's any
                traffic or not.
              </p>

              />
              <p>
                On switches sometimes the same LED is used for both link and
                activity status. It might even indicate other things like link
                speed. You'll have to read up on a particular piece of hardware
                you're working with but there will almost always be some
                troubleshooting data available to you through ports lights.
                Sometimes a network port isn't connected directly to a device.
                Instead, there might be network ports mounted in a wall or
                underneath your desk. These ports are generally connected to the
                network via cables ran through the walls that eventually end at
                a patch panel.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/patch-panel.jpeg" alt="patch panel" />
              <p>
                A patch panel is a device containing many network ports, but it
                does no otherwork. It's just a container for the endpoints of
                many runs of cable.Additional cables are then generally ran from
                a patch panel, two switches orrouters to provide network access
                to the computers at the other end of thoselinks.

              <h4>Ethernet and MAC Addresses</h4>
              <p>
                Wireless and cellular internet access are quickly becoming some
                of the most common ways to connect computing devices to
                networks. And it's probably how you're connected right now. So
                you might be surprised to hear that traditional cable networks
                are still the most common option you find in the workplace and
                definitely in the data center. The protocol most widely used to
                send data across individual links is known as ethernet. Ethernet
                and the data link layer provide a means for software at higher
                levels of the stack to send and receive data.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/2/1/data-link-layer-table.jpeg"
                alt="data link layer"
              />
              <p>
                One of the primary purposes of this layer is to essentially
                abstract away the need for any other layers to care about the
                physical layer and what hardware is in use. By dumping this
                responsibility on the data link layer, the internet transport
                and application layers can all operate the same no matter how
                the device they're running on is connected.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, for example, your web browser doesn't need to know if it's
                running on a device connected via twisted pair or wireless
                connection, it just needs the underlying layers to send and
                receive data for it. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able
                to explain what MAC addresses are and how they're used to
                identify computers. You'll also know how to describe the various
                components that make up an ethernet frame. And you'll be able to
                differentiate between Uni-Cast, multicast, and broadcast
                addresses. Lastly, you'll be able to explain how cyclical
                redundancy checks, help ensure the integrity of data sent via
                ethernet.
              </p>

                Understanding these concepts will help you troubleshoot a
                variety of problems as an IT support specialist. Warning, a
                history lesson on old school technology is headed your way. Here
                goes. Ethernet is a fairly old technology. It first came into
                being in 1980 and saw its first fully published standardization
                in 1983. Since then, a few changes have been introduced
                primarily in order to support ever increasing bandwidth needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the most part though, the ethernet in use today is
                comparable to the ethernet standard as first published all those
                years ago. In 1983, computer networking was totally different
                than it is today. One of the notable differences in land
                topology was that the switch or switchable hub hadn't been
                invented yet. This meant that frequently many or all devices on
                a network shared a single collision domain.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/data-colision2.jpeg" alt="collision domain" />
              <p>
                You might remember from our discussion about hubs and switches
                that a collision domain is a network segment where only one
                device can speak at a time. This is because all data in a
                collision domain is sent to all the nodes connected to it. If
                two computers were to send data across the wire at the same
                time, this would result in literal collisions of the electrical
                current representing our ones and zeros, leaving the end result
                unintelligible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ethernet as a protocol solve this problem by using a technique
                known as carrier sense multiple access with collision detection.
                Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. We generally abbreviate
                this to CSMA CD.
              </p>
              <p>
                CSMA CD is used to determine when the communications channels
                are clear and when the device is free to transmit data. The way
                CSMA CD works is actually pretty simple. If there's no data
                currently being transmitted on the network segment, a node will
                feel free to send data. If it turns out that two or more
                computers end up trying to send data at the same time, the
                computers detect this collision and stop sending data.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/csma-cd.jpeg" alt="CSMA CD" />
              <p>
                Each device involved with the collision then waits a random
                interval of time before trying to send data again. This random
                interval, helps to prevent all the computers involved in the
                collision from colliding again the next time they try to
                transmit anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a network segment is a collision domain, it means that all
                devices on that segment receive all communication across the
                entire segment. This means we need a way to identify which node
                the transmission was actually meant for. This is where something
                known as a media access control address or MAC address comes
                into play.
              </p>
              <p>
                A MAC address is a globally unique identifier attached to an
                individual network interface. It's a 48-bit number normally
                represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers. Just
                like how binary is a way to represent numbers with only two
                digits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hexadecimal is a way to represent numbers using 16 digits. Since
                we don't have numerals to represent any individual digit larger
                than nine, hexadecimal numbers employ the letters A, B, C, D, E
                and F to represent the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/hexadecimal.jpeg" alt="hexadecimal number" />
              <p>
                Another way to reference each group of numbers in a MAC address
                is an octet. In octet, in computer networking is any number that
                can be represented by 8-bits. In this case, two hexadecimal
                digits can represent the same numbers that 8-bits can.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, you may have noticed that we mentioned that MAC addresses
                are globally unique, which might have left you wondering how
                that could possibly be. The short answer is that a 48-bit number
                is much larger than you might expect. The total number of
                possible MAC addresses that could exist is two to the power of
                48 or 281,474,976,710,656 unique possibilities. That's a whole
                lot of possibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                A MAC address is split into two sections. The first three octets
                of a MAC address are known as the organizationally unique
                identifier or OUI. These are assigned to individual hardware
                manufacturers by the IEEE or the Institute of Electrical and
                Electronics Engineers. This is a useful bit of information to
                keep in your back pocket because it means that you can always
                identify the manufacturer of a network interface purely by its
                MAC address.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/1/mac-address-scheme.jpeg" alt="mac address" />
              <p>
                The last three octets of a MAC address can be assigned in any
                way that the manufacturer would like, with the condition that
                they only assign each possible address once to keep all MAC
                addresses globally unique. Ethernet uses MAC addresses to ensure
                that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that
                sent the transmission, as well as, the one that the transmission
                was intended for. In this way, even on a network segment acting
                as a single collision domain, each node on that network knows
                when traffic is intended for it.

              <h4>Resourse Record Types</h4>
              <p>
                Remember, DNS is one of the most important technologies that an
                IT support specialist needs to know in order to troubleshoot
                networking issues.
                <b
                  >DNS in practice, operates with a set of defined resource
                  record types. These allow for different kinds of DNS
                  resolutions to take place.</b
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                There are dozens of different resource record types to find, but
                a lot of them only serve very specialized purposes. We'll cover
                the most basic ones here. The most common resource record is
                known as an A record.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                An <span class="important_word">A record</span> is used to point
                a certain domain name at a certain IPv4 IP address.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our earlier discussions of DNS, we made the assumption that
                the DNS resolver was asking for the A record for a domain name.
                In its most basic use,
                <b
                  >a single A record is configured for a single domain name, but
                  a single domain name can have multiple A records too</b
                >. This allows for a technique known as DNS round robin to be
                used to balance traffic across multiple IPs.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Round robin is a concept that involves iterating over a list of
                items one by one in an orderly fashion. The hope is that this
                ensures a fairly equal balance of each entry on the list that's
                selected.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's say we're in charge of a domain name www.microsoft.com.
                Microsoft is a large company, and their website likely sees a
                lot of traffic. To help balance this traffic across multiple
                servers, we configure four A records for www.microsoft.com at
                the authoritative name server for the microsoft.com domain.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'll use the IPs 10.1.1.1, 10.1.1.2, 10.1.1.3, and 10.1.1.4.
                <b
                  >When a DNS resolver performs a look up of www.microsoft.com,
                  all four IPs would be returned in the order</b
                >, first configured. 10.1.1.1 followed by 10.1.1.2, followed by
                10.1.1.3, and finally 10.1.1.4. The
                <b
                  >DNS resolving computer would know that it should try to use
                  the first entry, 10.1.1.1. But it knows about all four just in
                  case a connection to 10.1.1.1 fails</b
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next computer to perform a look up for www.microsoft.com,
                would also receive all four IPs in the response, but the
                ordering will have changed. The first entry would be 10.1.1.2,
                followed by 10.1.1.3, followed by 10.1.1.4, and finally 10.1.1.1
                would be last on that list.
                <b
                  >This pattern would continue for every DNS resolution attempt,
                  cycling through all of the A records configured, and balancing
                  the traffic across these IPs</b
                >. That's the basics of how DNS round robin logic works.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another resource record type that's becoming more and more
                popular is the quad A record.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                A quad A record is very similar to an A record, except that it
                returns an IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 address.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The CNAME record is also super common. A CNAME record is used to
                redirect traffic from one domain to another.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's say that Microsoft runs their web servers at
                www.microsoft.com. They also want to make sure that anyone that
                enters just microsoft.com into their web browser, will get
                properly redirected. By configuring a CNAME record for
                microsoft.com that resolves to www.microsoft.com, the resolving
                client would then know to perform another resolution attempt,
                this time, for www.microsoft.com, and then use the IP returned
                by that second attempt.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >CNAMEs are really useful because they ensure you only have to
                  change the canonical IP address of a server in one place</b
                >. In fact, CNAME it's just shorthand for canonical name. If we
                look again at our original example of making sure that visitors
                to both microsoft.com and www.microsoft.com, get to the same
                place, we could do this in two ways. We could set up identical A
                records for both microsoft.com and www.microsoft.com domain
                names. And this would work just fine. But if the underlying IP
                address ever changes, we need to change it in two places, the A
                records for both microsoft.com and www.microsoft.com.
              </p>
              <p>
                By setting up a CNAME that points microsoft.com at
                www.microsoft.com, you'd only have to change the A record for
                www.microsoft.com. And you know the clients pointing at either
                domain would get the new IP address. This might not seem like a
                huge deal with just two records to worry about, but large
                companies with complex presences on the web might have dozens of
                these kinds of redirections. It's always easier to only have one
                source of truth.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Another important resource record type is the MX record. MX
                stands for mail exchange, and this resource record is used in
                order to deliver email to the correct server. Many companies run
                their web and mail servers on different machines with different
                IPs. So the MX record makes it easy to ensure that email gets
                delivered to a company's mail server, while other traffic like
                web traffic, would get delivered to their web server.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Record type very similar to the MX record, is the SRV record.
                SRV stands for service record, and it's used to define the
                location of various specific services. It serves the exact same
                purpose as the MX resource record type except for one thing,
                while MX is only for mail services, an SRV record can be defined
                to return the specifics of many different service types. For
                example, SRV records are often used to return the records of
                services like Cal Dave, which is a calendar and scheduling
                service.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The text record type is an interesting one. TXT stands for text,
                and was originally intended to be used only for associating some
                descriptive text with a domain name for human consumption.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea was that you could leave notes or messages that humans
                could discover and read to learn more about arbitrary specifics
                of your network. But over the years as the internet and services
                that run on it have become more and more complex, the text
                record has been increasingly used to convey additional data
                intended for other computers to process. Since the text record
                has a field that's entirely free form, clever engineers have
                figured it out ways to use it to communicate data not originally
                intended to be communicated by a system like DNS. It's pretty
                clever, right?
                <b
                  >This text record is often used to communicate configuration
                  preferences about network services that you've entrusted other
                  organizations to handle for your domain</b
                >.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, it's common for the text record to be used to
                convey additional info to an email as a service provider, which
                is a company that handles your email delivery for you. There are
                lots of other DNS resource record types in common use, like the
                NS or SOA records which are used to define authoritative
                information about DNS zones.

              <h4>Anatomy of Domain Name</h4>
              <p class="important">
                Any given domain name has three primary parts, and they all
                serve specific purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's take the domain name www.google.com, the three part here
                should be pretty easy to spot since they're each set off from
                each other by a period. They're www, google, and com,
                <b
                  >the last part of a domain name is known as the TLD or Top
                  Level Domain</b
                >. In this case it's the .com portion of the domain name.
                <b
                  >There are only a certain restricted number of defined TLDs
                  available</b
                >, although that number has been growing a lot in recent years.
                The most common TLDs are ones you're probably already familiar
                with .com, .net, .edu and so on. You've probably also seen some
                country specific TLDs such as .de for Germany or .cn for China.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to the growth of the Internet, many of the TLDs originally
                defined have become very crowded. So today, a number of vanity
                TLDs are available, everything from .museum to .pizza.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Administration and definition of TLDs is handled by a non-profit
                organization known as ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for
                Assigned Names and Numbers. ICANN is a sister organization to
                the IANA, and together they help define and control both the
                global IP spaces, along with the global DNS system.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >A domain is the name commonly used to refer to the second

                  example</b
                >. Domains are used to demarcate where control moves from a TLD
                name server, to an authoritative name server. This is typically
                under the control of an independent organization, or someone
                outside of ICANN.
              </p>
              <p>
                Domains can be registered and chosen by any individual or
                company, but they must all end in one of the predefined TLDs.
                That www portion of this is known as the subdomain, sometimes
                referred to as a host name if it's been assigned to only one
                host.
                <b
                  >When you combine all these parts together, you have what's
                  known as a fully qualified domain name, or FQDN</b

              <h4>DNS Zones</h4>
              <p>
                We've covered how authoritative name servers are responsible for
                responding to name resolution requests for a specific domains,
                but they do more than that.
                <b
                  >An authoritative name server is actually responsible for a
                  specific DNS zone</b
                >. DNS zones are a hierarchical concept. The root name servers
                we covered earlier are responsible for the root zone.
                <b
                  >Each TLD name server is responsible for the zone covering its
                  specific TLD</b
                >. What we referred to as authoritative name servers are
                responsible for some even finer grained zones underneath that.
              </p>
              <p>
                The root and TLD name servers are actually just authoritative
                name servers too. It's just that the zones at their authority
                for are special cases. I should call out that zones don't
                overlap. For example the administrative authority of the TLD
                name server for the.com TLD doesn't encompass the google.com
                domain. Instead, it ends at the authoritative server responsible
                for google.com.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The purpose of DNS zones is to allow for easier control over
                multiple levels of a domain.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the number of resource records in a single domain increases,
                it becomes more of a headache to manage them all. Network
                administrators can ease this pain by splitting up their
                configurations into multiple zones.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's imagine a large company that owns the domain,
                largecompany.com. This company has offices in Los Angeles,
                Paris, and Shanghai. Very cosmopolitan. Let's say each office
                has around 200 people with their own uniquely named desktop
                computer. This would be 600A records to keep track of if it was
                all configured as a single zone. What the company could do
                instead is split up each office into their own zone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now we can have la.largecompany.com, pa.largecompany.com, and
                sh.largecompany.com as subdomains, each with their own DNS zone.
                A total of four authoritative name servers would now be required
                for the setup. One for largecompany.com and one for each of the
                sub domains. Zones are configured through what are known as zone
                files, simple configuration files that declare all resource
                records for a particular zone. A zone file has to contain an SOA
                or a Start of Authority resource record declaration. This SOA
                record declares the zone and the name of the name server that is
                authoritative for it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along with the SOA record, you'll usually find NS records which
                indicate other name servers that might also be responsible for
                this zone. For simplicity sake, we've been referring to server
                in the singular when discussing what's responsible for a zone
                weather at the root, TLD or domain level. But there are often
                going to be multiple physical servers with their own FQDNs and
                IP addresses involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having multiple servers in place for something as important as
                DNS is pretty common. Why? Well, if one server were to have a
                problem or suffer a harbor failure, you can always rely on one
                of the other ones to serve DNS traffic. Besides SOA and NS
                records, you'll also find some or all of the other resource
                record types we've already covered, like A, Quad A and CNAME
                records, along with configurations such as default TTL values
                for the record served by this zone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like how subdomains can go many layers deep, zones can be
                configured to do this too. But just like with subdomains, it's
                rare to see zones deeper than just a few levels. Sometimes you
                will also see what are known as reverse lookup zone files. These
                let DNS resolvers ask for an IP and get the FQDN associated with
                it returned. These files are the same as zone files, except
                instead of A and Quad A records which resolve names to IPs,
                you'll find mostly pointer resource record declarations. As you
                might have guessed, a PTR or Pointer Record resolves an IP to a
                name. (Required) en ​

              <h4>Overview of DHCP</h4>
              <p>
                Managing hosts on a network can be a daunting and time-consuming
                task.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Every single computer on a modern TCP IP-based network needs to
                have at least four things specifically configured, an IP
                address, the subnet mask for the local network, a primary
                gateway, and a name server.
              </p>
              <p>
                On their own, these four things don't seem like much, but when
                you have to configure them on hundreds of machines, it becomes
                super tedious. Out of these four things, three are likely the
                same on just about every node on the network, the subnet mask,
                the primary gateway, and DNS server but the last item, an IP
                address needs to be different on every single node on the
                network. That could require a lot of tricky configuration work
                and this is where DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
                comes into play.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/4/dhcp-server.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                Listen up, because DHCP is critical to know as an IT support
                specialist when it comes to troubleshooting networks.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                DHCP is an application layer protocol that automates the
                configuration process of hosts on a network. With DHCP, a
                machine can query a DHCP server when the computer connects to
                the network and receive all the networking configuration in one
                go.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only does DHCP reduce the administrative overhead of having
                to configure lots of network devices on a single network, it
                also helps address the problem of having to choose what IP to
                assign to what machine. Every computer on a network requires an
                IP for communications, but very few of them require an IP that
                would be commonly known.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b
                  >For servers or network equipment on your network, like your
                  gateway router, a static and known IP address is pretty
                  important</b
                >. For example, the devices on a network need to know the IP of
                their gateway at all times. If the local DNS server was
                malfunctioning, network administrators would still need a way to
                connect to some of these devices through their IP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without aesthetic IP configured for a DNS server, it would be
                hard to connect to it, to diagnose any problems if it was
                malfunctioning but for a bunch of client devices, like desktops
                or laptops, or even mobile phones, it's really only important
                that they have an IP on the right network. It's much less
                important exactly which IP that is. Using DHCP, you can
                configure a range of IP addresses that's set aside for these
                client devices.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/4/configure-ip-address.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                This ensures that any of these devices can obtain an IP address
                when they need one. But solves the problem of having to maintain
                a list of every node on the network and its corresponding IP.
              </p>
              <p>There are a few standard ways that DHCP can operate:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>DHCP, dynamic allocation</b> is the most common, and it
                  works how we described it just now, a range of IP addresses is
                  set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to
                  these devices when they request one. Under a dynamic
                  allocation, the IP of a computer could be different almost
                  every time it connects to the network.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Automatic allocation</b> is very similar to dynamic
                  allocation in that a range of IP addresses is set aside for
                  assignment purposes. The main difference here is that the DHCP
                  server is asked to keep track of which IPs it's assigned to
                  certain devices in the past.
                  <img src="image/2/4/assigning-ip.jpeg" alt="" />
                  <p>
                    <b
                      >Using this information, the DHCP server will assign the
                      same IP to the same machine each time if possible</b
                    >.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, there's what's known as <b>fixed allocation</b>.
                  Fixed allocation requires a manually specified list of MAC
                  address and their corresponding IPs. When a computer requests
                  an IP, the DHCP server looks for its MAC address in a table
                  and assigns the IP that corresponds to that MAC address.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <img src="image/2/4/looking-for-mac-address-table.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                If the MAC address isn't found, the DHCP server might fall back
                to automatic or dynamic allocation, or it might refuse to assign
                an IP altogether. This can be used as a security measure to
                ensure that only devices that have had their MAC address
                specifically configured at the DHCP server will ever be able to
                obtain an IP and communicate on the network.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/4/fix-allocation.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                It's worth calling out that DHCP discovery can be used to
                configure lots of things beyond what we've touched on here.
                Along with things like IP address and primary gateway, you can
                also use DHCP to assign things like NTP servers. NTP stands for
                Network Time Protocol and is used to keep all computers on a
                network synchronized in time.​

              <h4>DHCP in Action</h4>
              <p class="important">
                DHCP is an application layer protocol, which means it relies on
                the transport, network, data link, and physical layers to
                operate.
              </p>
              <p>
                But you might have noticed that the entire point of DHCP is to
                help configure the network layer itself. Let's take a look at
                exactly how DHCP works and how it accomplishes communication's
                without a network layer configuration in place. Warning, geeky
                stuff ahead.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The process by which a client configured to use DHCP attempts to
                get network configuration information is known as DHCP
                discovery.
              </p>
              <p>The DHCP discovery process has four steps.</p>
              <ul></ul>
              <li>
                First, we have the <b>server discovery step</b>. The DHCP client
                sends what's known as a DHCP discover message out onto the
                network. Since the machine doesn't have an IP and it doesn't
                know the IP of the DHCP server, a specially crafted broadcast
                message is formed instead. DHCP listens on UDP port 67 and DHCP
                discovery messages are always sent from UDP port 68. The DHCP
                discover message is encapsulated in a UDP datagram with a
                destination port of 67 and a source port of 68.
                <img src="image/2/4/dhcp-discover.jpeg" alt="" />
                This is then encapsulated inside of an IP datagram with a
                destination IP of 255.255.255.255 and a source IP of 0.0.0.0.
                This broadcast message would get delivered to every node on the
                local area network, and if a DHCP server is present, it would
                receive this message.
              </li>
              <li></li>

              Next, the DHCP server would examine its own configuration and
              would make a decision on what, if any, IP address to offer to the
              client. This will depend on if it's configured to run with
              dynamic, automatic or fixed address allocation. The response would
              be sent as a DHCP offer message with a destination port of 68, a
              source port of 67, a destination broadcast IP of 255.255.255.255,
              and its actual IP as the source.
              <img src="image/2/4/dhcp-offer.jpeg" alt="" />
              Since the DHCP Offer is also a broadcast, it would reach every
              machine on the network. The original client would recognize that
              this message was intended for itself. This is because the DHCP
              offer has the field that specifies the MAC address of the client
              that sent the DHCP discover message. The client machine would now
              process this DHCP offer to see what IP is being offered to it.
              Technically, a DHCP client could reject this offer. It's totally
              possible for multiple DHCP servers to be running on the same
              network and for a DHCP client to be configured to only respond to
              an offer of an IP within a certain range. But this is rare. More
              often, the DHCP client would respond to the DHCP offer message
              with a DHCP request message. This message essentially says, yes, I
              would like to have an IP that you offered to me. Since the IP
              hasn't been assigned yet, this is again sent from an IP of 0.0.0.0
              and to the broadcast IP of 255.255.255.255.
              <img src="image/2/4/dhcp-request.jpeg" alt="" />
              Finally, the DHCP server receives the DHCP request message and
              respond with a DHCPACK or DHCP Acknowledgement message. This
              message is again sent to a broadcast IP of 255.255.255.255, and
              with a source IP corresponding to the actual IP of the DHCP
              server.
              <img src="image/2/4/dhcp-ack.jpeg" alt="" />
              Again, the DHCP client would recognize that this message was
              intended for itself by inclusion of its MAC address in one of the
              message fields. The networking stack on the client computer can
              now use the configuration information presented to it by the DHCP
              server to set up its own network layer configuration. At this
              stage, the computer that's acting as the DHCP client should have
              all the information it needs to operate in a full-fledged manner
              on the network it's connected to. All of this configuration is
              known as DHCP lease, as it includes an expiration time. A DHCP
              lease might last for days or only for a short amount of time. Once
              a lease has expired, the DHCP client would need to negotiate a new
              lease by performing the entire DHCP discovery process all over
              again. A client can also release its lease to the DHCP server,
              which it would do when it disconnects from the network. This would
              allow the DHCP server to return the IP address that was assigned
              to its pool of available IPs. (Required) en ​

              <h4>Basics of NAT</h4>
              <p>
                Welcome back, ready to dive right in? Unlike protocols like DNS
                and DHCP, Network Address Translation or NAT, is a technique
                instead of a defined standard. This means that some of what
                we'll discuss in this lesson might be more high level than some
                of our other topics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Different operating systems and different network hardware
                vendors have implemented the details of NAT in different ways,
                but the concepts of what it accomplishes are pretty constant.
                Network Address Translation does pretty much what it sounds
                like. It takes one IP address and translates it into another.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are lots of reasons why you would want to do this. They
                range from security safeguards to preserving the limited amount
                of available IPV4 space. We'll discuss the implications of NAT
                and the IPV4 address space later in this lesson, but for now,
                let's just focus on how NAT itself works and how it can provide
                additional security measures to a network.

              <p>
                At its most basic level, NAT is a technology that allows a
                gateway, usually a router or a firewall to rewrite the source IP
                of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP in
                order to rewrite it into the response.
              </p>
              <p>
                To explain this better, let's look at a simple NAT example.
                Let's say we have two networks. Network A consists of the
                10.1.1.0/24 address space, and Network B consists of the
                192.168.1.0/24 address space. Sitting between these networks is
                a router that has an interface on Network A with an IP of
                10.1.1.1 and an interface on Network B of 192.168.1.1. Now,
                let's put two computers on these networks. Computer 1 is on
                Network A and has an IP of 10.1.1.100 and Computer 2 is on
                Network B and has an IP of 192.168.1.100. Computer 1 wants to
                communicate with a web server on Computer 2.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/4/nat.jpeg" alt="" />
              It crafts the appropriate packet at all layers and sends this to
              its primary gateway, the router sitting between the two networks.
              So far, this is a lot like many of our earlier examples, but in
              this instance, the router is configured to perform NAT for any
              outbound packets. Normally, a router will inspect the contents of
              an IP datagram, decrement the TTL by one, recalculate the checksum
              and forward the rest of the data at the network layer without
              touching it, but with NAT, the router will also rewrite the source
              IP address, which in this instance becomes the router's IP on
              Network B or 192.168.1.1.
              <img src="image/2/4/nat2.jpeg" alt="" />
              When the datagram gets to Computer 2, it will look like it
              originated from the router, not from Computer 1. Now, Computer 2
              crafts its response and sends it back to the router. The router,
              knowing that this traffic is actually intended for Computer 1,
              rewrites the destination IP field before forwarding it along. What
              NAT is doing in this example is hiding the IP of Computer 1 from
              Computer 2. This is known as IP masquerading. IP masquerading is
              an important security concept. The most basic concept at play here
              is that no one can establish a connection to your computer if they
              don't know what IP address it has. By using NAT in the way we've
              just described. We could actually have hundreds of computers on
              Network A, all of their IPs being translated by the router to its
              own. To the outside world, the entire address space of Network A
              is protected and invisible. This is known as one-to-many NAT, and
              you'll see it in use on lots of LANs today. (Required) en ​

              <h4>NAT and the Transport Layer</h4>
              NAT at the network layer is pretty easy to follow. One IP address
              is translated to another by a device, usually a router. But at the
              transport layer, things get a little bit more complicated and
              several additional techniques come into play to make sure
              everything works properly. With one-to-many NAT, we've talked
              about how hundreds, even thousands of computers can all have their
              outbound traffic translated via NAT to a single IP. This is pretty
              easy to understand when the traffic is
              <span title="">outbound</span>, but a little more complicated once
              return traffic is involved. We now have potentially hundreds of
              responses all directed at the same IP and the router at this IP
              needs to figure out which responses go to which computer. The
              simplest way to do this is through port preservation. Port
              preservation is a technique where the source port chosen by a
              client is the same port used by the router. Remember that outbound
              connections choose a source port at random from the ephemeral
              ports or the ports in the range 49,152 through 65,535. In the
              simplest setup, a router setup to NAT outbound traffic will just
              keep track of what the source port is and use that to direct
              traffic back to the right computer. Let's imagine a device with an
              IP of 10.1.1.100. It wants to establish an outbound connection and
              the networking stack of the operating system chooses port 51,300
              for this connection. Once this outbound connection gets to the
              router, it performs network address translation and places its own
              IP in the source address field of the IP datagram, but it leaves
              the source port in the TCP datagram the same, and stores this data
              internally in a table.
              <img src="image/2/4/port-preservation.jpeg" alt="" />
              Now, when traffic returns to the router on port 51,300, it knows
              that this traffic needs to be forwarded back to the IP,
              10.1.1.100. Even with how large the set of ephemeral ports is,
              it's still possible for two different computers on a network to
              both choose the same source port around the same time. When this
              happens, the router normally selects an unused port at random to
              use instead. Another important concept about NAT and the transport
              layer is port forwarding. Port forwarding is a technique where
              specific destination ports can be configured to always be
              delivered to specific nodes. This technique allows for complete IP
              masquerading while still having services that can respond to
              incoming traffic. Let's use our network 10.1.1.0/24, again, to
              demonstrate this. Let's say there's a web server configured with
              an IP of 10.1.1.5. With port forwarding, no one would even have to
              know this IP. Prospective web clients would only have to know
              about the external IP of the router, let's say it's 192.168.1.1.
              Any traffic directed at port 80 on 192.168.1.1 would get
              automatically forwarded to 10.1.1.5. Response traffic would have
              the source IP rewritten to look like the external IP of the
              router.
              <img src="image/2/4/port-forwarding.jpeg" alt="" />
              This technique not only allows for IP masquerading, it also
              simplifies how external users might interact with lots of services
              all run by the same organization. Let's imagine a company with
              both a web server and a mail server. Both need to be accessible to
              the outside world but they run on different servers with different
              IPs. Again, let's say the web server has an IP of 10.1.1.5 and the
              mail server has an IP of 10.1.1.6, with port forwarding, traffic
              for either of these services could be aimed at the same external
              IP and therefore the same DNS name, but it would get delivered to
              entirely different internal servers due to their different
              destination ports.

              <h4>Supplemental Reading for IPv4 Address Exhaustion</h4>
              <h5>IPv4 Address Exhaustion</h5>
              <p>
                IT professionals are responsible for troubleshooting network
                connections. If a device cannot connect to the network, the IP
                address is used as a part of a command line to test if the
                device is the issue. The
              </p>
              <p>
                Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) distributes IP
                addresses, so unique addresses are used when connecting to the
                internet. Since 1988 IANA has assigned IP addresses, but the
                internet has expanded drastically, requiring billions of IP
                addresses. The possible combinations of numbers (4.2 billion)
                have almost run out. This reading will explain the structure for
                the distribution of IP addresses and how IPv6 is being used to
                solve the limited number of IP addresses available.

              <h5>Regional internet registries (RIRs)</h5>
              <p>
                IANA assigns IP address blocks to the five regional internet
                registries (RIRs). An RIR is an organization that manages
                internet number resources within a geographical region. IANA is
                responsible for assigning address blocks to five Regional
                Internet Registries (RIRs):

                On February 3, 2011, IATA assigned the last unallocated /8 of
                the 4.2 billion possible combinations of IPv4 addresses. In some
                regions, you use a recycled number as a new IP address due to
                reaching IP exhaustion. The RIRs exhausted the following blocks
                by date:

              </ul>
              <h6>IPv6</h6>
              <p>
                IPv6 will replace IPv4, using 128-bit addresses. IPv6 provides
                an identification and location system for computers on networks
                and routes traffic across the internet. The 128-bit addresses
                used by IPv6 provide a practically inexhaustible number of
                addresses. While IPv6 will solve many IPv4 address exhaustion
                issues, 99% of the devices in use today still use IPv4. IT
                professionals should be aware of IPv6 as it begins to take
                effect over the coming years and the structure of IP addresses
                changes.
              </p>
              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                The current system used for IP addresses, IPv4, has exhausted
                the combinations of numbers possible.

              <h4>Virtual Private Networks</h4>
              Businesses have lots of reasons to want to keep their network
              secure. They do this by using some of the technologies we've
              already discussed, firewalls, NAT, the use of non-routable address
              space, things like that. Organizations often have proprietary
              information that needs to remain secure, network services that are
              only intended for employees to access and other things. One of the
              easiest ways to keep network secure is to use various securing
              technologies. Only devices physically connected to their local
              area network can access these resources.
              <img src="image/2/4/vpn-tunnel.jpeg" alt="" />
              But employees aren't always in the office. They might be working
              from home or on a business trip, and they might still need access
              to these resources in order to get their work done. That's where
              VPNs come in. Virtual private networks, or VPNs, or a technology
              that allows for the extension of a private or local network to a
              host them might not work on that same local network. VPNs come in
              many flavors and accomplish lots of different things. But the most
              common example of how VPNs are used is for employees to access
              their businesses network when they're not in the office. VPNs are
              a tunneling protocol, which means they provision access to
              something not locally available. When establishing a VPN
              connection, you might also say that a VPN tunnel has been
              established. Let's go back to the example of an employee who needs
              to access company resources while not in the office. The employee
              could use a VPN client to establish a VPN tunnel to their company
              network. This would provision their computer with what's known as
              a virtual interface with an IP that matches the address space of
              the network they've established a VPN connection to. By sending
              data out of this virtual interface, the computer could access
              internal resources, just like if it was physically connected to
              the private network.
              <img src="image/2/4/vpn-packet.jpeg" alt="" />
              Most VPNs work by using the payload section of the transport layer
              to carry an encrypted payload that actually contains an entire
              second set of packets, the network, the transport, and the
              application layers of a packet intended to traverse the remote
              network.
              <img src="image/2/4/vpn-payload.jpeg" alt="" />
              Basically, this payload is carried to the VPN's endpoint where all
              the other layers are stripped away and discarded. Then the payload
              is unencrypted, leaving the VPN server with the top three layers
              of a new packet. This gets encapsulated with the proper data link
              layer information and sent out across the network. This process is
              completed in the inverse in the opposite direction. VPNs usually
              require strict authentication procedures in order to ensure that
              they can only be connected to buy computers and users authorized
              to do so. In fact, VPNs were one of the first technologies where
              two-factor authentication became common. Two-factor authentication
              is a technique where more than just a username and password are
              required to authenticate. Usually, a short-lived numerical token
              is generated by the user through a specialized piece of hardware
              or software. VPNs can also be used to establish site-to-site
              connectivity. Conceptually, there isn't much difference between
              how this works compared to our remote employees situation. It's
              just that the router, or sometimes a specialized VPN device on one
              network, establishes the VPN tunnel to the router or VPN device on
              another network.
              <img src="image/2/4/vpn-tunnel-2.jpeg" alt="" />
              This way, two physically separated offices might be able to act as
              one network and access network resources across the tunnel. It's
              important to call out that just like Nat, VPN or a general
              technology concept, not a strictly defined protocol. There are
              lots of unique implementations of VPNs and the details of how they
              all work can differ a ton.
              <img src="image/2/4/2-offices-1-network.jpeg" alt="" />
              The most important takeaway is that VPNs are a technology they use
              encrypted tunnels to allow for a remote computer or network to act
              as if it's connected to a network that it's not actually
              physically connected to. (Required) en ​

              <h4>Proxy Services</h4>
              A proxy service is a server that acts on behalf of a client in
              order to access another service. Proxies sit between clients and
              other servers, providing some additional benefit. Anonymity,
              security, content filtering, increased performance, a couple of
              other things. If any part of this sounds familiar, that's good.
              We've already covered some specific examples of proxies like
              gateway routers. You don't hear them referred to this way, but a
              gateway definitely meets the definition of what a proxy is and how
              it works. The concept of a proxy is just that, a concept or an
              abstraction. It doesn't refer to any specific implementation.
              Proxies exist at almost every layer of our networking model. There
              are dozens and dozens of examples of proxies you might run into
              during your career. But we'll cover just a few of the most common
              ones here. Most often you'll hear the term proxy used to refer to
              web proxies. As you might guess, these are proxies specifically
              built for web traffic. A web proxy can serve lots of purposes.
              Many years ago, when most Internet connections were much slower
              than they are today, lots of organizations used web proxies for
              increased performance. Using a web proxy in organization would
              direct all web traffic through it, allowing the proxy server
              itself to actually retrieve the webpage data from the Internet. It
              would then cache this data.
              <img src="image/2/4/web-proxy-earlier.jpeg" alt="" />
              This way, if someone else requested the same webpage, it could
              just return the cache data instead of having to retrieve the fresh
              copy every time. This proxy is pretty old and you won't often find
              them in use today. Why? Well, for one thing, most organizations
              now have connections fast enough that caching individual webpages
              doesn't provide much benefit. Also, the web has become much more
              dynamic. Going to www.twitter.com is going to look different to
              every person with their own Twitter account. Caching this data
              wouldn't do much good. A more common use of a web proxy today
              might be to prevent someone from accessing sites like Twitter
              entirely. A company might decide that accessing Twitter during
              work hours reduces productivity. By using a web proxy, they can
              direct all web traffic to it, allow the proxy to inspect what data
              is being requested and then allow or deny this request depending
              on what site is being accessed.
              <img src="image/2/4/web-proxy-now.jpeg" alt="" />
              Another example of a proxy, as a reverse proxy. A reverse proxy is
              a service that might appear to be a single server to external
              clients, but actually represents many servers living behind it. A
              good example of this is how lots of popular websites are
              architected today. Very popular websites like Twitter receives so
              much traffic that there's no way single web server could possibly
              handle all of it. A website that popular might need many web
              servers in order to keep up with processing all incoming requests.
              A reverse proxy in this situation could act as a single front end
              for many web servers living behind it. From the client's
              perspective, it looks like they're all connected to the same
              server. But behind the scenes, this reverse proxy server is
              actually distributing these incoming requests to lots of different
              physical servers.
              <img src="image/2/4/reverse-proxy.jpeg" alt="" />
              Much like the concept of DNS round robin, this is a form of load
              balancing. Another way that reverse proxies are commonly used by
              popular websites is to deal with decryption. More than half of all
              traffic on the web is now encrypted. Encrypting and decrypting
              data is a process that can take a lot of processing power. Reverse
              proxies are now implemented in order to use hardware built
              specifically for cryptography to perform the encryption and
              decryption work so that the web servers are free to just serve
              content.
              <img src="image/2/4/decription.jpeg" alt="" />
              Proxies come in many other flavors, way too many for us to cover
              them all here. But the most important takeaway is that proxies are
              any server that act as an intermediary between a client and
              another server. Good job. We covered a lot.

              when the device is free to transmit data Client: A device that
              receives data from a server CLOSE_WAIT: A connection state that
              indicates that the connection has been closed at the TCP layer,
              but that the application that opened the socket hasn't released
              its hold on the socket yet CLOSE: A connection state that

              segment where only one device can communicate at a time Computer
              networking: The full scope of how computers communicate with each
              other Connection-oriented protocol: A data-transmission protocol
              that establishes a connection at the transport layer, and uses
              this to ensure that all data has been properly transmitted
              Connectionless protocol: A data-transmission protocol that allows
              data to be exchanged without an established connection at the
              transport layer. The most common of these is known as UDP, or User
              Datagram Protocol Copper cable categories: These categories have
              different physical characteristics like the number of twists in
              the pair of copper wires. These are defined as names like category
              (or cat) 5, 5e, or 6, and how quickly data can be sent across them
              and how resistant they are to outside interference are all related
              to the way the twisted pairs inside are arranged Crosstalk:
              Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally
              detected on another wire Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC): A
              mathematical transformation that uses polynomial division to
              create a number that represents a larger set of data. It is an
              important concept for data integrity and is used all over
              computing, not just network transmissions D Data offset field: The
              data offset field indicates where the actual data payload begins
              within the TCP segment. Data packet: An all-encompassing term that
              represents any single set of binary data being sent across a
              network link Datalink layer: The layer in which the first
              protocols are introduced. This layer is responsible for defining a
              common way of interpreting signals, so network devices can
              communicate Demarcate: To set the boundaries of something
              Demarcation point: Where one network or system ends and another

              such as in an IP address Duplex communication: A form of
              communication where information can flow in both directions across
              a cable Dynamic IP address: An IP address assigned automatically
              to a new device through a technology known as Dynamic Host
              Configuration Protocol E ESTABLISHED: Status indicating that the
              TCP connection is in working order, and both sides are free to
              send each other data Ethernet frame: A highly structured
              collection of information presented in a specific order Ethernet:
              The protocol most widely used to send data across individual links
              EtherType field: It follows the Source MAC Address in a dataframe.

              optical fibers which are tiny tubes made of glass about the width
              of a human hair. Unlike copper, which uses electrical voltages,
              fiber cables use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros
              of the underlying data FIN_WAIT: A TCP socket state indicating
              that a FIN has been sent, but the corresponding ACK from the other
              end hasn't been received yet FIN: One of the TCP control flags.
              FIN is short for finish. When this flag is set to one, it means
              the transmitting computer doesn't have any more data to send and
              the connection can be closed Firewall: It is a device that blocks
              or allows traffic based on established rules Five layer model: A
              model used to explain how network devices communicate. This model

              communicate with each other at the exact same time H Half-duplex:
              It means that, while communication is possible in each direction,
              only one device can be communicating at a time Handshake: A way
              for two devices to ensure that they're speaking the same protocol
              and will be able to understand each other Header checksum field: A
              checksum of the contents of the entire IP datagram header Header
              length field: A four bit field that declares how long the entire
              header is. It is almost always 20 bytes in length when dealing
              with IPv4 Hexadecimal: A way to represent numbers using a
              numerical base of 16 Hub: It is a physical layer device that

              together Instantiation: The actual implementation of something
              defined elsewhere Interface: For a router, the port where a router
              connects to a network. A router gives and receives data through
              its interfaces. These are also used as part of the routing table
              Interior gateway: Interior gateway protocols are used by routers
              to share information within a single autonomous system Internet
              Protocol (IP): The most common protocol used in the network layer

              consumer an internet connection Internetwork: A collection of
              networks connected together through routers - the most famous of
              these being the Internet IP datagram: A highly structured series
              of fields that are strictly defined IP options field: An optional
              field and is used to set special characteristics for datagrams

              charge moving across a standard copper network cable Multicast
              frame: If the least significant bit in the first octet of a
              destination address is set to one, it means you're dealing with a
              multicast frame. A multicast frame is similarly set to all devices
              on the local network signal, and it will be accepted or discarded
              by each device depending on criteria aside from their own hardware
              MAC address Multiplexing: It means that nodes on the network have
              the ability to direct traffic toward many different receiving
              services N Network Address Translation (NAT): A mitigation tool
              that lets organizations use one public IP address and many private
              IP addresses within the network Network layer: It's the layer that
              allows different networks to communicate with each other through
              devices known as routers. It is responsible for getting data
              delivered across a collection of networks Network port: The
              physical connector to be able to connect a device to the network.
              This may be attached directly to a device on a computer network,
              or could also be located on a wall or on a patch panel Network
              switch: It is a level 2 or data link device that can connect to
              many devices so they can communicate. It can inspect the contents
              of the Ethernet protocol data being sent around the network,
              determine which system the data is intended for and then only send
              that data to that one system Next hop: The IP address of the next
              router that should receive data intended for the destination
              networking question or this could just state the network is
              directly connected and that there aren't any additional hops
              needed. Defined as part of the routing table Node: Any device
              connected to a network. On most networks, each node will typically

              field: It is sometimes used for more complicated flow control
              protocols Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI): The first
              three octets of a MAC address OSI model: A model used to define
              how network devices communicate. This model has seven layers that
              stack on top of each other: Physical, Data Link, Network,
              Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application P Padding field:
              A series of zeros used to ensure the header is the correct total
              size Patch panel: A device containing many physical network ports
              Payload: The actual data being transported, which is everything
              that isn't a header Physical layer: It represents the physical

              networked computer Preamble: The first part of an Ethernet frame,
              it is 8 bytes or 64 bits long and can itself be split into two
              sections Presentation layer: It is responsible for making sure
              that the unencapsulated application layer data is actually able to

              properly is called a protocol PSH flag: One of the TCP control
              flags. PSH is short for push. This flag means that the
              transmitting device wants the receiving device to push currently-
              buffered data to the application on the receiving end as soon as
              possible R Router: A device that knows how to forward data between
              independent networks Routing protocols: Special protocols the
              routers use to speak to each other in order to share what
              information they might have RST flag: One of the TCP control
              flags. RST is short for reset. This flag means that one of the
              sides in a TCP connection hasn't been able to properly recover
              from a series of missing or malformed segments S Sequence number:

              An IP address that must be manually configured on a node Subnet
              mask: 32-bit numbers that are normally written as four octets of
              decimal numbers Subnetting: The process of taking a large network
              and splitting it up into many individual smaller sub networks or
              subnets SYN flag: One of the TCP flags. SYN stands for
              synchronize. This flag is used when first establishing a TCP
              connection and make sure the receiving end knows to examine the
              sequence number field SYN_RECEIVED: A TCP socket state that means
              that a socket previously in a listener state, has received a
              synchronization request and sent a SYN_ACK back SYN_SENT: A TCP
              socket state that means that a synchronization request has been
              sent, but the connection hasn't been established yet T TCP
              checksum: A mechanism that makes sure that no data is lost or
              corrupted during a transfer TCP segment: A payload section of an

              before it's thrown away Total hops: The total number of devices
              data passes through to get from its source to its destination.
              Routers try to choose the shortest path, so fewest hops possible.
              The routing table is used to keep track of this Total length
              field: A 16-bit field that indicates the total length of the IP
              datagram it's attached to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): The
              data transfer protocol most commonly used in the fourth layer.
              This protocol requires an established connection between the
              client and server Transport layer: The network layer that sorts
              out which client and server programs are supposed to get the data

              transmission is always meant for just one receiving address URG
              flag: One of the TCP control flags. URG is short for urgent. A
              value of one here indicates that the segment is considered urgent
              and that the urgent pointer field has more data about this Urgent
              pointer field: A field used in conjunction with one of the TCP
              control flags to point out particular segments that might be more
              important than others User Datagram Protocol (UDP): A transfer
              protocol that does not rely on connections. This protocol does not
              support the concept of an acknowledgement. With UDP, you just set
              a destination port and send the data packet V Virtual LAN (VLAN):
              It is a technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs
              operating on the same physical equipment VLAN header: A piece of
              data that indicates what the frame itself is. In a data packet it

            <div class="article__part">Dial-up and Modems</div>

            As computer use grew over the course of the 20th century, it became
            obvious that there was a big need to connect computers to each other
            so that they could share data. For years before Ethernet, TCP, or
            IP, were ever invented, there were computer networks made up of
            technologies way more primitive than the model we've been
            discussing. These early networking technologies mostly focused on
            connecting devices within close physical proximity to each other. In
            the late 1970s, two graduate students at Duke University were trying
            to come up with a better way to connect computers at further
            distances. They wanted to share what was essentially bulletin board
            material then a light bulb moment went off. They realized the basic
            infrastructure for this already existed, the public telephone
            network. The Public Switched Telephone Network, or PSTN, is also
            sometimes referred to as the Plain Old Telephone Service or POTS. It
            was already a pretty global and powerful system by the late 1970s,
            more than 100 years after the invention of the telephone. These Duke
            grad students weren't the first ones to think about using a phone
            line to transmit data. But they were the first to do it in a way
            that became somewhat permanent precursor to the dial-up networks to
            follow. The system they built is known as Usenet and a form of it is
            still in use today. At the time, different locations like colleges
            and universities used a very primitive form of a dial-up connection
            to exchange a series of messages with each other. A dial-up
            connection uses POTS for data transfer and gets its name because the
            connection is established by actually dialing a phone number. If you
            used dial-up back in the day, this noise might sound familiar to
            you.
            <img src="image/2/5/dial-up.jpeg" alt="" />
            For some of us, it was like nails on a chalkboard as we waited to
            get connected to the Internet. Transferring data across a dial-up
            connection is done through devices called modems. Modem stands for
            modulator demodulator and they take data that computers can
            understand and turn them into audible wavelengths that can be
            transmitted over POTS.
            <img src="image/2/5/modems.jpeg" alt="" />
            After all, the telephone system was developed to transmit voice
            messages or sounds from one place to another. This is conceptually
            similar to how line coding is used to turn ones and zeros into
            modulating electrical charges across Ethernet cables. Early modems
            had very low baud rates. A baud rate is a measurement of how many
            bits could be passed across a phone line in a second. By the late
            1950s, computers could generally only send each other data across a
            phone line at about 110 bits per second. By the time Usenet was
            being developed, this rate had increased to around 300 bits per
            second. By the time dial-up access to the Internet became a
            household commodity in the early 1990s, this rate had increased to
            14.4 kilo bits per seconds. Improvements continued to be made, but
            widespread adoption of broadband technologies, dial-up Internet
            connectivity is pretty rare today, but it hasn't completely gone
            away. In some rural areas, it might be the only option still
            available. You might never run into a dial-up Internet connection
            during your IT career, but it's still important to know that for
            several decades, this technology represented the main way computers
            communicated with each other over long distances. I'm just glad we
            don't have to choose between using the phone or using the Internet
            anymore. (Required) en ​

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>What is broadband?</h4>
              The term broadband has a few definitions, in terms of internet
              connectivity, it's used to refer to any connectivity technology
              that isn't dial-up internet. Broadband internet is almost always
              much faster than even the fastest dial-up connections, and refers
              to connections that are always on. This means that there are long
              lasting connections that don't need to be established with each
              use, they're essentially links that are always present. Broadband
              shaped today's world. While the internet itself is a totally
              amazing invention, it wasn't until the advent of broadband
              technologies, that its true potential for business and home users
              was realized. Long before people had broadband connections at
              home, businesses, spent a lot of resources on them. Usually out of
              necessity, if you had an office with more than a few employees,
              the bandwidth available by a single dialogue connection would
              quickly be over saturated by just a few users. By the mid 1990s,
              it had become pretty common for businesses that needed internet
              access for their employees to use various T-carrier technologies.
              T-carrier technologies were originally invented by AT&T in order
              to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link. Eventually,
              they also became common transmission systems to transfer data much
              faster than any dial-up connection could handle. After businesses
              got into the broadband game, home use became more prevalent. As
              different aspects of the internet like the World wide Web became
              more complex, they also required ever increasing data transfer
              rates. In the days of dial-up, even a single image on a web page
              could take many seconds to download and display. High resolution
              photos that you can now take on a cellphone, would have required a
              long time to download, and a lot of your patience. A single
              picture taken on a smartphone today can easily be several
              megabytes in size. Two megabytes would translate to 16,777,216
              bits at a baud rate of 14.4 kilobits per second. That many bits
              would take nearly 20 minutes to download.
              <img src="image/2/5/long-download.jpeg" alt="" />
              No one would have had time to download all the hilarious cat
              images on the Internet back then. What a travesty! Without
              broadband Internet connection technologies, the Internet as we
              know it today, wouldn't exist. We wouldn't be able to stream music
              or movies, or easily share photos. You definitely couldn't be
              taking an online course like this. T-carrier technologies require
              dedicated lines which makes them more expensive. For this reason
              you usually only see them in use by businesses. But other
              broadband solutions also exist for both businesses and consumers.

              <h4>T-Carrier Technologies</h4>
              T-carrier technologies were first invented by AT&T, in order to
              provision a system that allowed lots of phone calls to travel
              across a single cable. Every individual phone call was made over
              individual pairs of copper wire before Transmission System 1, the
              first T-carrier specification called T1 for short. With the T1
              specification, AT&T invented a way to carry up to 24 simultaneous
              phone calls across a single piece of twisted pair copper. Years
              later, the same technology was repurposed for data transfers. Each
              of the 24 phone channels was capable of transmitting data at 64
              kilobits per second, making a single T1 line capable of
              transmitting data at 1.544 megabits per second. Over the years,
              the phrase T1 has come to mean any twisted pair copper connection
              capable of speeds of 1.544 megabits per second. Even if it doesn't
              strictly follow the original Transmission System 1 specification.
              Originally, T1 technology was only used to connect different
              telecom company sites to each other and to connect these companies
              to other telecom companies. But with the rise of the internet as a
              useful business tool in the 1990s, more and more businesses
              started to pay to have T1 lines installed at their offices to have
              faster Internet connectivity. More improvements to the T1 line,
              were made by developing a way of multiple T1s, to act as a single
              link. AT3 line is 28 T1s all multiplexed, achieving a total
              throughput speed of 44.736 megabits per second. You'll still find
              T-carrier technologies in use today, but they've usually been
              surpassed by other broadband technologies. For small business
              offices, cable broadband or fiber connections are now way more
              common, since they're much cheaper to operate. For inner ISP
              communications, different fiber technologies have all replaced
              older copper based ones.

              <h4>Digital Subscriber Lines</h4>

              The public telephone network was a great option for getting people
              connected to the Internet since it already had infrastructure
              everywhere. For a long time, dial-up connections were the main way
              that people connected to the Internet from home. As people wanted
              faster and faster Internet access, telephone companies began to
              wonder if they could use the same infrastructure, but in a
              different way. The research showed that twisted pair copper used
              by modern telephone lines was capable of transmitting way more
              data than what was needed for voice to voice calls. By operating
              at a frequency range that didn't interfere with normal phone
              calls, a technology known as digital subscriber line or DSL, was
              able to send much more data across the wire than traditional
              dial-up technologies, and to top it all off, this allowed for
              normal voice phone calls and data transfer to occur at the same
              time on the same line.
              <img src="image/2/5/dsl.jpeg" alt="" />
              Like how dial-up uses modems, DSL technologies also use their own
              modems. But more accurately they're known as DSLAMs or digital
              subscriber line access multiplexers. Just like dial-up modems,
              these devices establish data connections across phone lines, but
              unlike dial-up connections, they're usually long running. This
              means that the connection is generally established when the DSLAM
              is powered on and isn't torn down until the DSLAM is powered off.
              There are lots of different DSL available, but they all vary in a
              pretty minor way. For a long time, the two most common types of
              DSL were ADSL and SDSL. ADSL stands for Asymmetric Digital
              Subscriber Line. ADSL connections feature different speeds for
              outbound and incoming data. Generally, this means faster download
              speeds and slower upload speeds. Home users rarely need to upload
              as much data as they download, since home users are mostly just
              clients. For example, when you open a web page in a web browser,
              the upload or outbound data is pretty small. You're just asking
              for a certain webpage from the web server. The download or inbound
              data tends to be much larger since it will contain the entire
              webpage, including all images and other media.
              <img src="image/2/5/upload-download.jpeg" alt="" />
              For this reason, asymmetric lines often provide a similar user
              experience for a typical home user, but at a lower cost. SDSL as
              you might be able to guess, stands for Symmetric Digital
              Subscriber Line. SDSL technology is basically the same as ADSL,
              except the upload and download speeds are the same. At one point,
              SDSL was mainly used by businesses that hosted servers that needed
              to send data to clients. As the general bandwidth available on the
              Internet has expanded and as the cost of operation have come down
              over the years, SDSL is now more common for both businesses and
              home users. Most SDSL technologies have an upper cap of 1.544
              megabits a second or the same as a T1 line. Further developments
              in SDSL technology have yielded things like HDSL or High bit-rate
              Digital Subscriber Lines. These are DSL technologies that
              provision speeds above 1.544 megabits per second. There are lots
              of other minor variations in DSL technology out in the wild
              offering different bandwidth options and operating distances.
              These variations can be so numerous and minor. It's not really

              <h4>Cable Broadband</h4>
              The history of both the telephone and computer networking tells a
              story that started with all communications being wired. But the
              recent trend is moving towards more and more of this traffic
              becoming wireless. The history of television follows the opposite
              path. Originally, all television broadcasts were wireless
              transmissions sent out by giant television towers and received by
              smaller antennas in people's homes. This meant you had to be
              within a range of one of these television towers to watch TV, just
              like you have to be within range of a cell phone tower to use your
              cell phone today. Starting in the late 1940s in the United States,
              the first cable television technologies were developed. At the
              time, they mainly wanted to provide television access to remote
              towns and rural homes that were out of range of capabilities of
              television towers at the time. Cable television continued to
              expand slowly over the decades. But in 1984, the Cable
              Communications Policy Act was passed. This deregulated the cable
              television business in the United States and caused a massive boom
              in growth and adoption. Other countries all over the globe soon
              followed. By the early 1990s, cable television infrastructure in
              the United States was about the size of the public telephone
              system. Not too long after that, cable providers started trying to
              figure out if they could join in on the massive spike in Internet
              growth that was happening at the same time. Much like how DSL was
              developed cable companies quickly realized that the coaxial
              cables, generally used by cable television delivery into a
              person's home were capable of transmitting much more data than
              what was required for TV viewing. By using frequencies that don't
              interfere with television broadcast, cable-based internet access
              technologies were able to deliver high speed Internet access
              across these same cables.
              <img src="image/2/5/tv-phone-frequency.jpeg" alt="" />
              This is the technology we refer to when we say cable broadband.
              One of the main differences in how cable internet access works
              when compared to other broadband solutions is that cable is
              generally what's known as a shared bandwidth technology. With
              technologies like DSL or even dial up, the connection from your
              home or business goes directly to what's known as a central office
              or CO. A long time ago, the COs were actually offices staffed with
              telephone operators who used a switchboard to manually connect the
              caller with a callee. As technology improved, the COs became
              smaller pieces of automated hardware that handled these functions
              for the telephone companies, but the name stayed the same.
              <img src="image/2/5/central-office-co.jpeg" alt="" />
              Technologies that connect directly to a CO can guarantee a certain
              amount of bandwidth available over that connection since it's
              point to point. On the flip side of this, are cable Internet
              technologies which employ a shared bandwidth model. With this
              model in place, many users share a certain amount of bandwidth
              until the transmissions reach the ISPs core network. This could be
              anywhere from a single city block to entire subdivisions in the
              suburbs. It just depends on how that area was originally wired for
              cable.
              <img src="image/2/5/cable-dsl.jpeg" alt="" />
              Today, most cable operators have tried to upgrade their networks
              to the point that end users might not always notice this shared
              bandwidth. But it's also still common to see cable internet
              connections slow down during periods of heavy use, like when lots
              of people in the same region are using their Internet connection
              at the same time. Cable Internet connections are usually managed
              by what's known as a cable modem. This is a device that sits at
              the edge of a consumer's network and connects it to the cable
              modem termination system or CMTS. The CMTS is what connects lots
              of different cable connections to an ISP's core network.

              <h4>Fiber Connections</h4>
              The core of the Internet has long used fiber for its connections,
              both due to higher speeds and because fiber allows for
              transmission to travel much further without degradation of the
              signal. Remember that fiber connections use light for data
              transmission instead of electrical currents. The absolute maximum
              distance an electrical signal can travel across a copper cable
              before it degrades too much and requires a repeater is thousands
              of feet. But certain implementations of fiber connections can
              travel many miles before signal degrades. Producing and laying
              fiber is a lot more expensive than using copper cables. For a long
              time, it was a technology you only saw in use by ISPs within their
              core networks, or maybe for use within data centers. But in recent
              years, it's become popular to use fiber to deliver data closer and
              closer to the end-user. Exactly how close to the end-user can vary
              a ton across implementations, which is why the phrase FTTX was
              developed. FTTX stands for fiber to the x, where the x can be one
              of many things. We'll cover a few of these possibilities. The
              first term you might hear is FTTN, which means fiber to the
              neighborhood. This means that fiber technologies are used to
              deliver data to a single physical cabinet that serves a certain
              amount of the population. From this cabinet, twisted pair copper
              or coax might be used for the last length of distance. The next
              version you might come across is FTTB. This stands for fiber to
              the building, fiber to the business, or even fiber to the
              basement. Since this is generally where cables to buildings
              physically enter. FTTB is a setup where fiber technologies are
              used for data delivery to an individual building. After that,
              twisted pair copper is typically used to actually connect those
              inside of the building. A third version you might hear is FTTH,
              which stands for fiber to the home. This is used in instances
              where fiber is actually run to each individual residence in a
              neighborhood or apartment building.
              <img src="image/2/5/fiber-connections.jpeg" alt="" />
              FTTH and FTTB may both also be referred to as FTTP, fiber to the
              premises. Instead of a modem, the demarcation point for fiber
              technologies is known as optical network terminator or ONT. ONT
              converts data from protocols the fiber network can understand to
              those that more traditional twisted pair copper networks can
              understand.

              <h4>Supplemental Reading for Broadband Protocols</h4>
              <p>Broadband Protocols</p>
              <p>
                Broadband communications require a set of instructions, rules,
                and communication to various network layer protocols to support
                operation. Point to Point Protocol (PPP) for broadband
                communications is a set of instructions used to transmit data
                between two directly connected devices. This reading will cover
                the definitions, structures, and details of Point to Point
                Protocol (PPP) and Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet
                (PPPoE).
              </p>
              <h5>Point to Point Protocol (PPP)</h5>
              <p>
                Point to Point Protocol (PPP) is a byte-oriented protocol
                broadly used for high-traffic data transmissions. PPP functions
                at the data link layer, which transmits data between two devices
                on the same network. PPP is designed to link devices, so the
                endpoints do not need to be the same vendor to work.
              </p>
              <h6>Configuring PPP</h6>
              <p>
                When configuring PPP for the devices on your network, you have
                the following options:
              </p>
              <ul>
                >
                <li>
                  <b>Multilink</b> connection provides a method for spreading
                  traffic across multiple distinct PPP connections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Compression</b> increases throughput by reducing the amount
                  of data in the frame.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Authentication</b> occurs when connected devices exchange
                  authentication messages using one of two methods:
                  <ul>
                    >
                    <li>
                      <b>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</b> is a
                      password authentication option that is hard to obtain
                      plaintext from if passwords are compromised.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)</b>
                      is a three-way handshake authentication that periodically
                      confirms the identity of the clients.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Error detection</b> includes Frame Check Sequence (FCS) and
                  looped link detection.

                    <li>
                      <b>Frame Check Sequence (FCS)</b> is a number included in
                      the frame calculated over the Address, Control, Protocol,
                      Information, and Padding fields used to determine if there
                      has been data loss during transmission.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Looped link detection</b> in PPP detects looped links
                      using magic numbers. A magic number is generated randomly
                      at each end of the connection, so when a looped message is
                      received, the device checks the magic number against its
                      own. If the line is looped, the number will match the
                      sender's magic number, and the frame is discarded.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Sub-protocols for PPP</h5>
              <p>
                In addition, two sub-protocols for PPP occur on the network
                layer when the network decides what physical path the
                information will take. These protocols use the configuration
                options you set for the endpoints.
              </p>
              <ul>
                >
                <li>
                  <b>Network Control Protocol (NCP)</b> will be used to
                  negotiate optional configuration parameters and facilities for
                  the network layer. There is an NCP for each higher layer
                  protocol used by the PPP.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Link Control Protocol (LCP)</b> initiates and terminates
                  connections automatically for hosts. It automatically
                  configures the interfaces at each end like magic numbers and
                  selecting for optional authentication.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Data is sent using PPP in a frame. A frame is a collection of
                data sent to a receiving point.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/5/ppp-frame.png" alt="" />
              <h6>PPP uses the following frame format:</h6>
              <ul>
                >
                <li>
                  <b>Flag</b> is a single byte and lets the receiver know this
                  is the beginning of the frame. Depending on the encapsulation,
                  there may or may not be a start flag or an end flag.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Address</b> is a single byte, and it contains the broadcast
                  address.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Control</b> is a single byte required for various purposes
                  but also allows a connectionless data link.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Protocol</b> varies from one to three bytes which identify
                  the network protocol of the datagram.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Data</b> is where the information you need to transmit is
                  stored and has a limit of 1500 bytes per frame.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Frame</b> check sequence (FCS) is 2 or 4 bytes and is used
                  to verify data is intact upon receipt at the endpoint.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When the data is packaged in a frame, it undergoes
                encapsulation.
              </p>
              <h6>Encapsulation</h6>
              <p>
                Encapsulation is the process by which each layer takes data from
                the previous layer and adds headers and trailers for the next
                layer to interpret.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/5/encapsuletion-deincapsulation.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                These frames are sent to the other endpoint where the process is
                reversed, which is called De-encapsulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                PPP can get expensive and hard to manage due to all the direct
                cables and links required. In this case, you may want to switch
                to a multi-access Ethernet solution. Point to Point Protocol
                over Ethernet is a protocol made to bridge the gap between
                directly connected endpoints and other devices.
              </p>
              <h5>Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)</h5>
              <p>
                Point to Point protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) is a way of
                encapsulating PPP frames inside an ethernet frame. PPPoE is a
                solution for tunneling packets over the DSL connection service
                provider's IP network and from there to the rest of the
                Internet. Like PPP, PPPoE provides authentication, encryption,
                and compression, though it primarily uses Password
                Authentication Protocol (PAP) for authentication.
              </p>
              <p>
                A common use case is PPPoE using DSL services where a PPPoE
                modem-router connects to the DSL service or when a PPPoE DSL
                modem is connected to a PPPoE-only router using an Ethernet
                cable.
              </p>
              <p>
                PPP is strictly point-to-point, so frames can only go to the
                intended destination. PPPoE requires a new step because ethernet
                connections are multi-access enabled (every node connects to
                another). This requires an additional step called the discovery
                stage. The discovery stage establishes a session ID to identify
                the hardware address. This stage ensures data gets routed to the
                correct place.
              </p>
              <p>
                PPPoE is an encapsulation of PPP inside an ethernet frame. PPPoE
                retains the same architecture, configuration options, and frame
                data as PPP but with one extra layer of ethernet encapsulation.
              </p>
              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                Broadband internet requires several protocols to make sure
                different connected devices can communicate with each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                Point to Point Protocol (PPP) encapsulates data, so any PPP
                configured devices can communicate without issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                Point to Point over Ethernet (PPPoE) is an extra layer of
                encapsulation for standard PPP frames, to enable data to be sent
                over ethernet connections.

              because IP addresses are scarce and expensive. You set up a router
              and configure it to perform NAT. You can figure a local DNS server
              and a DHCP server to make network configuration easier.
              <img src="image/2/5/wan.jpeg" alt="" />
              And of course for all of this to really work, you sign a contract
              with an ISP to deliver a link to the Internet to this office, so
              your users can access the web. Now imagine the company grows.
              You're using nonwritable address space for your internal IPs, so
              you have plenty of space to grow there. Maybe some sales people
              need to connect to resources on the land you've set up while
              they're on the road. So you configure a VPN server and make sure
              the VPN server is accessible via port forwarding.
              <img src="image/2/5/wan2.jpeg" alt="" />
              Now, you can have employees from all over the world connect to the
              office LAN. Business is good and the company keeps growing. The
              CEO decides that it's time to open a new office in another city
              across the country. Suddenly, instead of a handful of salespeople
              requiring remote access to the resources on your network, you have
              an entire second office that needs it. This is where Wide Area
              Networks or WAN technologies come into play. Unlike a LAN or a
              Local Area Network, WAN stands for Wide Area Network. A Wide Area
              Network acts like a single network, but spans across multiple
              physical locations. WAN technologies usually require that you
              contract a link across the Internet with your ISP. This ISP handle
              sending your data from one site to the other. So it could be like
              all of your computers are in the same physical location. A typical
              LAN setup has a few sections. Imagine one network of computers on
              one side of the country and another network of computers on the
              other. Each of those networks ends at a demarcation point which is
              where the ISPs Network takes over. The area between each
              demarcation point and the ISP's actual core network is called a
              local loop. This local loop would be something like a T carrier
              line or a high speed optical connection to the provider's local
              regional office. From there, it would connect out to the ISP's
              core network and the Internet at large.
              <img src="image/2/5/lan.jpeg" alt="" />
              WANs work by using a number of different protocols at the data
              link layer to transport your data from one site to another. In
              fact, these same protocols are what are sometimes at work at the
              core of the Internet itself instead of our more familiar ethernet.
              Covering all the details of these protocols is out of the scope of
              this course.

              <p>
                In this reading, you will continue learning about the various
                components of Wide Area Networks (WANs). WAN configurations are
                important for IT Support professionals to understand when
                working with the geographically dispersed networks of large
                organizations. WANs can be connected through the Internet with
                connections provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in
                each locale. Regional WANs can also be formed by connecting
                multiple Local Area Network (LAN) sites using equipment and
                cables leased from a regional ISP. Security for WANs across the
                public Internet can be configured through Virtual Private
                Networks (VPNs).

                <li>
                  <b>WAN router:</b> Hardware devices that act as intermediate
                  systems to route data amongst the LAN member groups of a WAN
                  (also called WAN endpoints) using a private connection. WAN
                  routers may also be called border routers or edge routers.
                  These routers facilitate an organization’s access to a carrier
                  network. WAN routers have a digital modem interface for the
                  WAN, which works at the OSI link layer, and an Ethernet
                  interface for the LAN.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN):</b> Software developed to
                  address the unique needs of cloud-based WAN environments.
                  SD-WANs can be used alone or in conjunction with a traditional
                  WAN. SD-WANs simplify how WANs are implemented, managed, and
                  maintained. An organization’s overall cost to operate a
                  cloud-based SD-WAN is significantly less than the overall cost
                  of equipping and maintaining a traditional WAN. One of the
                  ways that SD-WANs help reduce operational costs is by
                  replacing the need for expensive lines leased from an ISP by
                  linking regional LANs together to build a WAN.

              <h6>WAN optimization</h6>
              <p>
                There are multiple techniques available to optimize network
                traffic and data storage on a WAN:
              </p>
              <ul>
                >
                <li>
                  <b>Compression:</b> Reducing file sizes to improve network
                  traffic efficiency. There are many compression algorithms
                  available for text, image, video, etc. The sender and the
                  receiver will need apps that offer the same
                  compression/decompression algorithm to encode and decode the
                  compressed files.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Deduplication:</b> Prevents files from being stored
                  multiple times within a network to avoid wasting expensive
                  hard drive space. One copy of the file is kept in a central
                  location. All other “copies” are actually file pointers to the
                  single copy of the file. This saves valuable hard drive space,
                  makes performing data backups more efficient, and reduces the
                  amount of time needed to recover from data loss disasters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Protocol Optimization:</b> Improves the efficiency of
                  networking protocols for applications that need higher
                  bandwidth and low latency.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Local Caching:</b> Storing local copies of network and
                  internet files on a user’s computer to reduce the need to
                  resend the same information across the network every time the
                  file is accessed. Some WAN optimization products can cache
                  shared files at one physical LAN location when groups of
                  employees at the location tend to request the same set of
                  files frequently. <b>Traffic Shaping:</b> Optimizing network
                  performance by controlling the flow of network traffic. Three
                  techniques are commonly used in traffic shaping:

                    <li>
                      <b>bandwidth throttling</b> - controlling network traffic
                      volume during peak use times
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>rate limiting</b> - capping maximum data rates/speeds
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>use of complex algorithms</b> - classifying and
                      prioritizing data to give preference to more important
                      traffic (e.g., an organization might want to prioritize
                      private LAN-to-LAN traffic within the organization’s WAN
                      and give a lower priority to employees accessing the
                      public Internet).

              </ul>
              <h5>WAN Protocols</h5>
              <p>
                WAN Internet Protocols are used in conjunction with WAN routers
                to perform the task of distinguishing between a private LAN and
                the related public WAN. Several WAN protocols have been
                developed over the decades for this task, as well as other
                purposes, including:
              </p>

                >
                <li>
                  <b>Packet switching:</b> A method of data transmission. In
                  packet switching, messages are broken into multiple packets.
                  Each packet contains a header that includes information on how
                  to reassemble the packets, as well as the intended destination
                  of the packets. As a measure to prevent data corruption, the
                  packets are triplicated. The triplicated packets are sent
                  separately over optimal routes through the internet. Then,
                  once the packets reach their destination, they are
                  reassembled. The triplicate copies are compared with one
                  another to detect and correct any data corruption that
                  occurred during transmission (at least two of the three copies
                  should match). If the data cannot be reassembled and/or data
                  corruption is evident in all three copies, the destination
                  will make a request to the origin to resend the packet.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Frame relay:</b> Also a method of data transmission. Frame
                  relay is an older technology originally designed for use on
                  Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines. However, the
                  technology is now used in other network interfaces. Frame
                  relays are used to transmit data between endpoints of a WAN
                  through a packet switching method that works at the OSI data
                  link and physical layers. A fast data communications network,
                  called a Frame Relay Network, is used to transport data
                  packets in frames. The reliability of Frame Relay Networks
                  minimizes the need for error checking. The frames include
                  routing address information for the destination.

                      data connections. Stays open even when data is not being
                      transmitted.

                      <b>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM):</b> ATM is an older
                      technology that encodes data using asynchronous
                      time-division multiplexing. The encoded data is packaged
                      into small, fixed-sized cells. ATM can send the cells over
                      a long distance, which makes it useful for WAN
                      communications. ATMs uses routers as end-points between
                      ATM networks and other networks. ATM technology has been
                      replaced for the most part by Internet Protocol (IP)
                      technologies.

                      <b>High Level Data Control (HLDC):</b> An encapsulation or
                      data link protocol that delivers data frames through a
                      network. The frames include multiple fields that can hold
                      information about start and end flags, controls, Frame
                      Check Sequence (FCS), and protocol used. HLDC was
                      developed to use multiple protocols to replace Synchronous
                      Data Link Control (SLDC), which used only one protocol.
                      HLDC includes error correction, flow control, and data
                      transmission through polling. HLDC has three modes to
                      define the relationship between two devices, or nodes,

              <h4>Point-to-Point VPNs</h4>
              A popular alternative to WAN technologies are point to point VPNS.
              WAN technologies are great for when you need to transport large
              amounts of data across lots of sites because WAN technologies are
              built to be super fast business cable or DSL line might be way
              cheaper. But it just can't handle the load required in some of
              these situations. But over the last few years, companies have been
              moving more and more of their internal services into the cloud.
              We'll cover exactly what this means later. But for now it's enough
              to know that the cloud lets companies outsource all or part of
              their different pieces of infrastructure to other companies to
              manage. Let's take the concept of email. In the past, a company
              would have to run their own email server if they wanted an email
              presence at all. Today, you could just have a cloud hosting
              provider host your email server for you. You could even go a step
              further and use an email as a service provider, then you wouldn't
              have an email server at all anymore. You just have to pay another
              company to handle everything about your email service with these
              types of cloud solutions in place. Lots of businesses no longer
              require extreme, high speed connections between their sites. This
              makes the expense of a WAN technology totally unnecessary.
              Instead, companies can use point to point VPNS to make sure that
              they're different sites can still communicate with each other. A
              point to point VPN also called a site to site VPN establishes a
              VPN tunnel between two sites.
              <img src="image/2/5/internet-vpn-tunnel.jpeg" alt="" />
              This operates a lot like the way that a traditional VPN setup lets
              individual users act as if they're on the network they're
              connecting to. It's just that the VPN tunneling logic is handled
              by network devices at either side so that users don't all have to
              establish their own connections.

              In today's world, fewer and fewer devices are weighed down by
              physical cables in order to connect to computer networks. With so
              many portable computing devices in use, from laptops to tablets to
              smartphones. We've also seen the rise of wireless networking.
              Wireless networking is exactly what it sounds like a way to
              network without wires. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able
              to describe the basics of how wireless communication works. You'll
              know how to tell the difference between infrastructure networks
              and ad hoc networks. You'll be able to explain how wireless
              channels, how wireless networks operate, and you'll understand the
              basics of wireless security protocols. The most common
              specifications for how wireless networking devices should
              communicate are defined by the IEEE 802.11 standards. This set of
              specifications, also called the 802.11 family make-up the set of
              technologies we call Wi-Fi. Wireless networking devices
              communicate with each other through radio waves. Different 802.11
              standards generally use the same basic protocol, but might operate
              at different frequency bands. A frequency band is a certain
              section of the radio spectrum that's been agreed upon to be used
              for certain communications. In North America, FM radio
              transmissions operate between 88 and 108 megahertz. This specific
              frequency band is called the FM broadcast band. Wi-Fi networks
              operate on a few different frequency bands, most commonly the 2.4
              gigahertz and 5 gigahertz bands. There are lots of 802.11
              specifications, including some that exists just experimentally or
              for testing. The most common specifications you might run into are
              802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. We won't go into
              detail about each one here. For now, just know that we've listed
              these in the order they were adopted. Each newer version of the
              802.11 specifications has generally seen some improvement, whether
              it's higher access speeds or the ability for more devices to use
              the network simultaneously. In terms of our networking model, you
              should think of 802.11 protocols as defining how we operate at
              both the physical and the data link layers. An 802.11 frame has a
              number of fields. The first is called the frame control field.
              <img src="image/2/5/frame-control.jpeg" alt="" />
              This field is 16 bits long and contains a number of sub-fields
              that are used to describe how the frame itself should be
              processed. This includes things like what version of the 802.11
              was used. The next field is called a duration field.
              <img src="image/2/5/duration.jpeg" alt="" />
              It specifies how long the total frame is. The receiver knows how
              long it should expect to have to listen to the transmission. After
              this are four address fields. Let's take a moment to talk about
              why there are four instead of the normal two. We'll discuss
              different types of wireless network architectures in more detail
              later in this lesson. But the most common setup includes devices
              called access points. A wireless access point is a device that
              bridges the wireless and wired portions of a network. A single
              wireless network might have lots of different access points to
              cover a large area. Devices on a wireless network will associate
              with a certain access point. This is usually the one they're
              physically closest to. But it can also be determined by all sorts
              of other things like general signal strength and wireless
              interference. Associations isn't just important for the wireless
              device to talk to a specific access point. It also allows for
              incoming transmissions to the wireless device to be sent by the
              right access point. There are four address fields, because there
              needs to be room to indicate which wireless access point should be
              processing the frame. So we'd have our normal source address
              field, which would represent the MAC address of the sending
              device. But we'd also have the intended destination on the
              network, along with a receiving address and a transmitter address.
              <img src="image/2/5/address-field.jpeg" alt="" />
              The receiver address would be the MAC address of the access point
              that should receive the frame. The transmitter address would be
              the MAC address of whatever has just transmitted the frame. In
              lots of situations, the destination and receiver address might be
              the same. Usually the source and transmitter addresses are also
              the same, but depending on exactly how a specific wireless network
              has been architected, this won't always be the case. Sometimes
              wireless access points will relay these frames from one another.
              Since all addresses in 802.11 frame are MAC addresses, each of
              those four fields is six bytes long. In-between the third and
              fourth address fields, you'll find the sequence control field.
              <img src="image/2/5/sequence-control.jpeg" alt="" />
              The sequence control field is 16 bits long and mainly contains a
              sequence number used to keep track of ordering the frames after
              this is the data payload section,
              <img src="image/2/5/data-payload.jpeg" alt="" />
              which has all of the data of the protocols further up the stack.
              Finally, we have a frame check sequence field,
              <img src="image/2/5/fcs.jpeg" alt="" />
              which contains a checksum used for a cyclical redundancy check,
              just like how Ethernet does it.

                  <b>Increased band capacity:</b> Band utilization increased
                  from 80mHz to 160mHz, creating a faster connection from the
                  router to connected devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Better performance:</b> The input/output streams are
                  doubled from the 4 by 4 allowed by Wi-Fi 5, to 8 by 8 in Wi-Fi
                  6, allowing more clients to be grouped.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Improved power efficiency:</b> Devices only connect to the
                  network when sending or receiving data, increasing battery
                  life.

                >
                <li>
                  Channel sharing for better efficiency and shortens the time it
                  takes to send data once a user gives the send command.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Target Wake Time (TWT) improves the network speed and
                  increases battery life by allowing battery-powered devices to
                  sleep when not in use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Multi-user MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output) wireless
                  technology allows more data to be transferred simultaneously.
                  This ability increases capacity and efficiency in high
                  bandwidth applications like voice calls or video streaming.

                  access point to separate devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Transmit beamforming is a technique that sends signals that
                  allow for more efficient higher data rates by targeting each
                  connected device.

              <h5>Wi-Fi 6E extends Wi-Fi 6 into 6 GHz</h5>
              <p>
                Wi-Fi 6E is an additional certification for Wi-Fi 6 that has all
                of the features of Wi-Fi 6 but adds a third 6 GHz band. Wi-Fi 6E
                has more channels to use to broadcast, including 14 more 80MHz
                channels and seven more 160MHz channels. The additional channels
                allow networks with Wi-Fi 6E for better performance even when
                streaming high-definition video or using virtual reality
                devices.

                As an IT Support specialist, you may be responsible for
                supporting wireless technologies. In this reading, you will
                learn about the 802.11 Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi) standards,
                including the alphabet-coded updates: a, b, g, n, ac, ad, af,
                ah, ax, ay, and az. You will also learn about the differences
                between the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) and 5 GHz Wi-Fi frequencies.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may already be familiar with selecting from the 2.4 GHz and
                5 GHz frequency options on your home Wi-Fi router. Perhaps you
                also noticed the 802.11 specifications on the packaging for your
                Wi-Fi router when you purchased it. Have you wondered what these
                numbers and letters mean?
              </p>
              <h5>Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies</h5>
              <p>
                There are multiple wireless technologies available today that
                use various frequencies ranging from radio to microwave bands.
                These wireless technologies include Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, ZigBee,
                Thread, Bluetooth, and Near Field Communication (NFC). Radio and
                microwave frequency bands each have specific ranges that are
                divided into channels. Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
                microwave radio frequency band ranges for sending and receiving
                data. Some Wi-Fi routers use multiple channels within each range
                to avoid signal interference and to load-balance network
                traffic. Wi-Fi is commonly used for wireless local area networks
                (WLANs).

              <p>
                In 1997, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
                (IEEE) ratified the first 802.11 standard for wireless fidelity
                (later branded as Wi-Fi). The standard was first published for
                use by computer device manufacturers to use as a common protocol
                for wireless communications. The IEEE has amended the 802.11
                specifications multiple times over the years with updates and
                additional enhancements to 802.11 Wi-Fi. The IEEE names each new
                amendment with one or two letters appended to 802.11 (e.g.,
                802.11n or 802.11ax). The IEEE plans to continue updating the
                802.11 specifications until a new technology replaces Wi-Fi.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of wireless networks use the IEEE 802.11 standards
                for Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi networks include client devices (e.g., laptops,
                tablets, smartphones, IoT devices, etc.) that are configured to
                connect to wireless access points. This configuration is
                referred to as “infrastructure mode”. Access points can serve
                both wireless and wired network traffic. For wired traffic, the
                access point works as a bridge between wireless devices and a
                wired network. The access point connects to an Ethernet switch
                through a wired Ethernet cable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The various amended 802.11 specifications use the same
                fundamental data link protocol. However, some characteristics
                may vary at the OSI physical layer, including:

                regulations on channel usage, power limitations, and Wi-Fi
                ranges. A technology called dynamic frequency selection (DFS) is
                also required to prevent 5 GHz Wi-Fi signals from interfering
                with local radar and satellite communications.

              <h4>Supplemental Reading for IoT Data Transfer Protocols</h4>
              <h5>IoT Data Transfer Protocols</h5>
              <p>
                In this reading, you will learn how Internet of Things (IoT)
                devices send and receive data across networks. As an IT Support
                specialist, you may need to support data collection from IoT
                devices. For example, you may work for a company that uses an
                array of IoT sensors in a manufacturing setting to help with the
                remote monitoring and proactive maintenance of industrial
                machines. You may need to manage the software applications and
                data transfer protocols that support automated and human
                interaction with the IoT devices and the data they collect.

              <h6>Data protocol models used with IoT</h6>
              <p>
                There are two common data protocol models to illustrate how
                low-power IoT devices share data:

                  <b>Request/Response model:</b> Often used in distributed
                  systems where the communication flow between servers and
                  clients consists of requests and responses for data. Examples
                  include HTTP and CoAP (described in the “IoT data protocols at
                  the application layer” section below)

                <li>
                  <b>Publish/Subscribe model:</b> A framework for message
                  exchanges between publishers (hosts) and subscribers (clients)
                  that are routed through a broker. Subscribers can sign up to a
                  channel to receive notices through the broker when the
                  publisher releases new messages. Examples: MQTT and AMQP
                  (described in the “IoT data protocols at the application
                  layer” section below).

              <h6>IoT data protocols at the application layer</h6>
              <p>
                IoT devices can collect environmental data around their physical
                location (e.g., temperature), equipment data (e.g., maintenance
                status), and metered data (e.g., electricity usage). Data
                protocols are needed to transfer and format the data for use by
                applications that interface with either humans or automated
                systems. IoT devices can be configured to use various data
                transfer and formatting protocols at the OSI
                application/software layer of communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most IoT devices can use at least one of the following data
                transfer protocols:

                  <b>HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secure (HTTP/HTTPS):</b> HTTP
                  and HTTPS are the most widely used information transfer
                  protocols across the World Wide Web (WWW). The protocols
                  define how information is formatted and transmitted.
                  HTTP/HTTPS uses ASCII formatting, has a header size of 8
                  bytes, and is designed for transmitting documents. HTTP/HTTPS
                  use either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User
                  Datagram Protocol (UDP) for sending information across the
                  internet. HTTP/HTTPS uses the request/response model. When a
                  website address is entered into a browser, HTTP/HTTPS sends a
                  request to the site’s web server, which then returns an
                  HTTP/HTTPS formatted response to the browser. The protocols
                  use ports 80 or 8080 and data security is provided on the
                  HTTPS version of the protocol. HTTP is supported by Google
                  Cloud IoT Core for device-to-cloud communication.

              <h4>Wireless Network Configurations</h4>
              There are a few main ways that a wireless network can be
              configured. There are ad-hoc networks where nodes all speak
              directly to each other. There are wireless LANS or WLANS, where
              one or more access points act as a bridge between a wireless and a
              wired network, and there are mesh networks which are a hybrid of
              the two. Ad-hoc networks are the simplest of the three. In an
              ad-hoc network, there isn't really any supporting network
              infrastructure. Every device involved with the network
              communicates with every other device within range, and all nodes
              help pass along messages.
              <img src="image/2/5/ad-hoc-network.jpeg" alt="" />
              Even though they're the most simple, ad-hoc networks aren't the
              most common type of wireless network, but they do have some
              practical applications. Some smartphones can establish ad-hoc
              networks with other smartphones in the area so that people can
              exchange photos, video, or contact information. You'll also
              sometimes see ad-hoc networks used in industrial or warehouse
              settings where individual pieces of equipment might need to
              communicate with each other, but not with anything else. Finally,
              ad-hoc networks can be powerful tools during disaster situations.
              If a natural disaster like an earthquake or hurricane knocks out
              all of the existing infrastructure in an area, disaster relief
              professionals can use an ad-hoc network to communicate with each
              other while they perform search and rescue efforts. The most
              common type of wireless network you'll run into in the business
              world is a wireless LAN, or WLAN. A wireless LAN consists of one
              or more access points which act as bridges between the wireless
              and wired networks.
              <img src="image/2/5/lan-wlan.jpeg" alt="" />
              The wired network operates as a normal LAN, like the types we've
              already discussed. The wired LAN contains the outbound Internet
              link. In order to access resources outside of the WLAN, wireless
              devices would communicate with access points. They then forward
              traffic along to the gateway router where everything proceeds like
              normal. Finally, we have what's known as mesh networks. Mesh
              networks are like ad-hoc networks, since lots of the devices
              communicate with each other wirelessly, forming a mesh.
              <img src="image/2/5/mesh-network.jpeg" alt="" />
              If you were to draw lines for all the links between all the nodes,
              most mesh networks you'll run into are made up of only wireless
              access points, and will still be connected to a wired network.
              This network lets you deploy more access points to the mesh
              without having to run a cable to each of them. With this setup,
              you can really increase the performance and range of a wireless
              network. (Required) en ​

              <h4>Wireless Channels</h4>
              The concept of channels is one of the most important things to
              understand about wireless networking. Channels are individual,
              smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless
              network. Channels are super important because they help address a
              very old networking concern, collision domains. You might remember
              that a collision domain is anyone network segment where one
              computer can interrupt another. Communications that overlap each
              other can't be properly understood by the receiving end. So when
              two or more transmissions occur at the same time, also called a
              collision, all devices in question have to stop their
              transmissions. They wait a random amount of time and try again
              when things quiet down. This really slows things down. The problem
              caused by collision domains has been mostly reduced on wired
              networks through devices called switches. Switches, remember which
              computers live on which physical interfaces? So traffic is only
              sent to the node it's intended for.W ireless networking doesn't
              have cables. So there aren't physical interfaces for a wireless
              device to connect to. That means we can have something that works
              like a wireless switch. Wireless devices are doomed to talk over
              each other, channels help fix this problem to a certain extent.
              When we were talking about the concept of frequency bands, we
              mentioned that FM radio in North America operates between 88
              megahertz and 188 megahertz. But when we discussed the frequency
              bands we used by wifi, we just mentioned 2.4 gigahertz and five
              gigahertz. This is because that's really just shorthand for where
              these frequency bands actually begin for wireless networks that
              operate on the 2.4 gigahertz band. What we really mean is that
              they operate on roughly the band from 2.4 gigahertz to 2.5
              gigahertz between these two frequencies are a number of channels,
              each with a width of a certain megahertz. Since different
              countries and regions have different regulatory committees for
              what radio frequencies might be used for what. Exactly how many
              channels are available for use depends on where in the world you
              are. For example, dealing with an 802.11 B network, channel 1
              operates at 24 12 megahertz. But since the channel with is 22
              megahertz, the signal really lives on the frequencies between
              2.401 megahertz and 2.423 megahertz.
              <img src="image/2/5/radio-frequences.jpeg" alt="" />
              This is because radio waves are imprecise things so you need some
              buffer around what exact frequencies a transmission might actually
              arrive on. Some channels overlap, but some are far enough apart so
              they won't interfere with each other at all.
              <img src="image/2/5/radio-chanales.jpeg" alt="" />
              Let's look again at an 802.11 B network running on the 2.4
              gigahertz band because it's really the simplest and the concepts
              translate to all other 802.11 specifications. With a channel width
              of 22 megahertz, Channel 1 with its midpoint at 2.412 megahertz is
              always completely isolated from channel 6with its midpoint at
              2.437 megahertz. For an 802.11 B network this means that channels
              1 and 6 and 11 are the only ones that never overlap at all.
              <img src="image/2/5/non-overlaping-channales.jpeg" alt="" />
              That's not all that matters though. Today, most wireless
              networking equipment is built to auto sense what channels are most
              congested. Some access points will only perform this analysis when
              they start up. Others will dynamically change their channel as
              needed. Between those two scenarios and manually specified
              channels you can still run into situations where you experience
              heavy channel congestion. This is especially true in dense urban
              areas with lots of wireless networks in close proximity. So why is
              this important in the world of IT support? Well, understanding how
              these channels overlap for all of the 802.11 specifications is a
              way you can help troubleshoot bad wireless connectivity problems
              or slowdowns in the network. You want to avoid collision domains
              wherever you can. I should call out that it's not important to
              memorize all of the individual numbers we've talked about. The
              point is to understand how collision domains are a necessary
              problem with all wireless networks and how you can use your
              knowledge in this space to optimize wireless network deployments.
              You want to make sure that both your own access points and those
              of neighboring businesses overlap channels as little as possible.

              <h4>Wireless Security</h4>
              When you're sending data over a wired link, your communication has
              a certain amount of inherent privacy. The only devices that really
              know what data is being transmitted are the two nodes on either
              end of the link. Someone or some device that happens to be in
              close proximity can't just read the data. With wireless networking
              this isn't really the case since there aren't cables just radio
              transmissions being broadcast through the air. Anyone within range
              could hypothetically intercept any transmissions whether they were
              intended for them or not. To solve this problem, WEP was invented.
              WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy and it's an encryption
              technology that provides a very low level of privacy. Actually
              it's really right there in the name Wired Equivalent Privacy.
              Using WEP protects your data a little, but it should really only
              be seen as being as safe as sending unencrypted data over a wired
              connection. The WEP standard is a really weak encryption
              algorithm. It doesn't take very long for a bad actor to be able to
              break through this encryption and read your data. You'll learn
              more about key lengths and encryption in a future course but for
              now it's important to know that the number of bits in an
              encryption key corresponds to how secure it is. The more bits in a
              key the longer it takes for someone to crack the encryption. WEP
              only uses 40 bits for its encryption keys and with the speed of
              modern computers this can usually be cracked in just a few
              minutes. WEP was quickly replaced in most places with WPA or Wifi
              Protected Access. WPA by default uses a 128-bit key, making it a
              whole lot more difficult to crack than WEP. Today the most
              commonly used encryption algorithm for wireless networks is WPA2,
              an update to the original WPA. WPA2 uses a 256 bit key, make it
              even harder to crack. Another common way to help secure wireless
              networks is through MAC filtering. With MAC filtering, you
              configure your access points to only allow for connections from a
              specific set of MAC addresses belonging to devices you trust. This
              doesn't do anything more to help encrypt wireless traffic being
              sent through the air, but it does provide an additional barrier
              preventing unauthorized devices from connecting to the wireless
              network itself.

              <h4>Protocols & Encryption</h4>
              <p>WPA3 Protocols & Encryption</p>
              Protocols and encryption are vital components in cybersecurity.
              Network security continues to evolve along with technological
              innovations and ever-increasing computing power. You have learned
              about WPA2 and how it improved the security of the Wi-Fi Protected
              Access (WPA) protocol. In this reading, you will explore WPA3, the
              third iteration of WPA wireless security. You will also learn
              about various internet connectivity technologies, as well as the
              basics of wireless and cellular networking.
              <p>
                WPA3 is built upon the WPA2 protocol and is intended to replace
                WPA2. The WPA3 protocol introduces new features and methods to
                repair the security weaknesses of WPA2. The benefits of this
                advancement in Wi-Fi security include:

              <h6>WPA3-Personal</h6>
              <p>
                WPA3-Personal is intended for individual users and personal/home
                Wi-Fi networks. This protocol addresses common cybersecurity
                weaknesses that affect consumers’ wireless devices. It also
                simplifies Wi-Fi security for users. The improvements to
                WPA3-Personal include:

                <li>
                  <b>Increased ease of use:</b> Users do not need to change the
                  way they connect to Wi-Fi to benefit from WPA3’s improved
                  security.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Forward secrecy:</b> If a password is stolen, WPA3 can

                <li>
                  <b>Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE):</b>
                  WPA3-Personal improves upon the WPA2-Personal Pre-Shared Key
                  (PSK) handshake protocol. SAE uses PSK to generate a Pairwise
                  Master Key (PMK). The PMK uses password-based authentication
                  and is shared between a Wi-Fi access point and a wireless
                  device. The pair use a complex, multi-stage process for
                  proving to one another that they each possess the PMK. This
                  complex handshake makes it extremely difficult for
                  cybercriminals to intercept packets in order to extract an
                  identifiable authentication key. If the SAE transaction is
                  successful, the wireless device will pass the authentication
                  stage and gain access to the secured Wi-Fi network.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The SAE authentication also reduces the probability of
                successful dictionary and brute force attacks, in which
                cybercriminals try to crack short, weak, and commonly used
                passwords. Additionally, SAE corrects a weakness exploited by
                cybercriminals who could perform key reinstallation attacks
                (KRACKs) when in close proximity to a Wi-Fi user. This type of
                attack could decrypt data and expose passwords, credit card
                information, photos, chats, emails, and more.
              </p>
              <h5>WPA3-Enterprise</h5>
              <p>
                WPA3-Enterprise is intended for business networks with multiple
                users. This protocol addresses the WPA2-Enterprise weaknesses
                that cybercriminals have been able to exploit. In addition to
                the WPA3-Personal SAE improvements, the WPA3-Enterprise security
                improvements and options include:
              </p>

                  <b>Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP-256):</b> The Advanced
                  Encryption Standard (AES) with GCMP-256-bit encryption
                  replaces the WPA2 128-bit AES-Counter Mode Protocol (CCMP)
                  Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC).
                  GCMP provides data integrity and confidentiality. The
                  GCMP-256-bit encryption strength takes significantly more
                  computing power for cybercriminals to crack than 128-bit
                  encryption. The average person would not have access to that
                  level of computing power. GCMP-256-bit encryption provides a
                  stronger security protocol and makes it harder for
                  cybercriminals to perform Meddler-in-the-Middle attacks.

                  <b>Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE):</b> OWE improves
                  upon the WPA2 wireless encryption standard of 802.1x Open
                  Authentication and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
                  In WPA2, EAP required additional support to help it encrypt
                  and authenticate login credentials. In the WPA3 protocol, OWE
                  replaces EAP with a solution that encrypts and authenticates
                  all wireless traffic. It also replaces Wi-Fi passwords by
                  assigning a unique key to each device that has permission to
                  access the network. This technology repairs a weakness Wi-Fi
                  users experience in open networks, which are often found in
                  restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, airports, malls, and more.

                  a user’s device. The hash code from the origin of the message
                  is compared to the hash code from the receiver of the message
                  to determine if the hash codes match. A discrepancy between
                  the two hashes would indicate that the message was compromised

              <h4>Cellular Networking</h4>
              Another super popular form of wireless networking is cellular
              networking, also called mobile networking. Cellular networks are
              now common all over the world. In some places, using a cellular
              network for Internet access is the most common way of connecting.
              At a high level, cellular networks have a lot in common with the
              802.11 networks we've already talked about. Just like there are
              many different 802.11 specifications, there are lots of different
              cellular specifications. Just like Wi-Fi, cellular networking
              operates over radio waves and there are specific frequency bands
              specifically reserved for cellular transmissions.
              <img src="image/2/5/radio-phone-frequency.jpeg" alt="" />
              One of the biggest differences is that these frequencies can
              travel over longer distances more easily, usually over many
              kilometers or miles. Cellular networks are built around the
              concept of cells. Each cell is assigned a specific frequency band
              for use.
              <img src="image/2/5/cells.jpeg" alt="" />
              Neighboring cells are set up to use bands that don't overlap. Just
              like how we discussed the optimal setup for a WLAN with multiple
              access points. In fact, the cell towers that broadcasts and
              receives cellular transmissions can be thought of like access
              points, just with a much larger range. Lots of devices today use
              cellular networks for communication, and not just phones, also
              tablets and some laptops also have cellular antennas. It's become
              more and more common for high-end automobiles to have built-in
              cellular access too.

              <h4>Mobile Device Networks</h4>
              Mobile devices use wireless networks to communicate with the
              internet and with other devices. Depending on the device it might
              use cellular networks, wifi, Bluetooth and or one of several
              internet of things or IOT network protocols. As an IT support
              specialist, you'll often have to help troubleshoot networking or
              connectivity issues for end users. You'll need to figure out what
              network the device should be connecting to and then make sure the
              device is configured to do that. For example turning individual
              components and systems on and off is a common feature in mobile
              devices which can sometimes be confusing for the end users.
              Battery life is precious and people switch off these network
              radios to save battery life if someone brings the device to you
              because it won't connect to a wireless network. The first thing
              you should check is whether the wireless radio has been disabled.
              Yep sometimes the solution is really that simple. You can toggle
              the wifi Bluetooth and cellular networks on or off in the devices
              settings. Riproduci il video a partire da :1:10 e segui la
              trascrizione1:10 Lots of mobile devices will also have an airplane
              mode that disables all wireless networking at once. It is also
              pretty common for a mobile device to have multiple network
              connections at the same time. Both wifi and cellular data for
              example, mobile devices will try to connect to the internet using
              the most reliable and least expensive connection available. That's
              right, I said least expensive. Many mobile operating systems
              understand the concept of metered connections. Does your cell
              phone plan have a limit on how much data you can use in a month or
              charge you based on how much data you use? Then you have immediate
              connection through that cell phone plan. Mobile devices will use
              other non metered connections like wi-fi if they're available so
              that you don't use up your limited data connection. Here's another
              example of how you might help as an IT support specialist. Let's
              say you have a remote employee that works from a coffee shop
              sometimes, but the wi-fi network in the coffee shop restricts
              access to some websites. The employee might choose to disconnect
              from the wifi network and use the sale network even though it
              might be more expensive. So that they can access the websites they
              need, by toggling the wi-fi and cellular data connections. You can
              force the device to use the network connection that you want to
              use, if you're troubleshooting an unreliable wireless network
              connection. Keep in mind that wireless networking works by sending
              a radio signal between two antennas. What? You don't see an
              antenna? Well surprise your device has one, it might be printed on
              a circuit board or it might have a wire or ribbon that runs
              through your device. The radio signal will get weaker the farther
              it has to travel, especially if it passes through or reflects off
              of things between the two antennas. Mobile devices can go with you
              to places where there's too much distance or interference for the
              wireless signal to be reliable. Even the way the mobile device is
              held or worn can impact the strength of the signal. So wi-fi and
              cellular data networks are used to connect your mobile devices to
              the Internet. But there's one other type of wireless network to
              talk about, mobile devices connect to their peripherals using
              short range wireless networks. The most common short range
              wireless network is called Bluetooth. You might have used
              Bluetooth headphones, keyboards or mice before. When you connect a
              wireless peripheral to a mobile device, we call that pairing the
              devices. The two devices exchange information, sometimes including
              a pin or password so that they can remember each other. From then
              on the devices will automatically connect to each other when
              they're both powered on and in range. Pairing devices like this
              can sometimes fail and you might need to make your device forget
              the peripheral so it can be paired again. Remember Bluetooth can
              be turned off very easily when you're troubleshooting a Bluetooth
              peripheral, always make sure that Bluetooth is on.

                In this reading, you will learn how Internet of Things (IoT)
                devices connect to wireless networks. As an IT Support
                specialist, you may need to support wireless IoT devices in a
                networked environment. For example, you may have a client who
                needs to install a smart, wireless security system for their
                home or office. The client might need assistance with connecting
                the security system to a private network for onsite monitoring
                and/or to the internet for remote monitoring. Understanding the
                properties of wireless IoT networks will help you select
                appropriate network protocols for various IoT applications.

              <h6>IoT wireless network protocols at the physical layer</h6>
              <p>
                IoT devices can use both wired and wireless methods to connect
                to the Internet. For wireless connections, there are multiple
                network protocols that manufacturers configure IoT devices to
                use. Some of these network protocols support global internet
                connectivity, while others are intended for short-distance
                Personal Area Networks (PANs). Network protocols connect at the
                OSI physical layer.

                    <b>Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi):</b> Wi-Fi is the more familiar
                    brand name for the IEEE 802.11 standard for wireless
                    networks. Wi-Fi is the most common wireless protocol across
                    the world, with billions of devices capable of using Wi-Fi,
                    including many IoT devices. Wi-Fi is a great option when
                    needing to integrate IoT devices into an existing IP network
                    that is connected to the internet. Wi-Fi 6 can support up to
                    500 Mbps data transfer speeds, for fast performance with
                    large amounts of data. IoT networks often include a hub or a
                    control system that uses Wi-Fi to facilitate wireless
                    networking.

                  <p>
                    As you have learned previously, Wi-Fi networks communicate
                    on radio frequencies 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz
                    frequency extends to 150 feet (45 meters) indoors and 300
                    feet (92 meters) outdoors. However, the 2.4 GHz frequency
                    can experience congestion due to a limited number of
                    channels. Plus, 2.4 GHz is more likely to experience
                    interference from other nearby devices that use the same
                    frequency, like microwaves. The 5 GHz frequency provides a
                    stronger signal than 2.4 GHz and has more channels to handle
                    more traffic. The 5 GHz drawback is that its range is
                    limited to 50 feet (12 meters) indoors and 100 feet (30.6
                    meters) outdoors.

                  less power than other wireless connectivity options. Wireless
                  mesh is a decentralized network of connected wireless access
                  points (WAP), also called nodes. Each WAP node forwards data
                  to the next node in the network until the data reaches its
                  destination. This network design is “self-healing,” meaning
                  the network can recover on its own when a node fails. The
                  other nodes will reroute data to exclude the failed node.
                  Wireless mesh is a good option for high reliability and low

                  Bluetooth has a range of up to 100 feet (30.6 meters) and can
                  accommodate multiple paired connections. It is a good choice
                  for creating a short distance wireless connection between
                  Bluetooth enabled devices. Bluetooth is often used by
                  computing devices to manage, configure, control, and/or
                  collect small amounts of data from one or more close range IoT
                  devices. For example, Bluetooth may be used to control smart
                  home lighting or thermostat IoT devices from a smartphone.

                  <b>Near-Field Communication (NFC):</b> NFC is a short-range,
                  low data, wireless communication protocol that operates on the
                  13.56 MHz radio frequency. NFC technology requires a physical
                  chip (or tag) to be embedded in the IoT device. NFC chips can
                  be found in credit and debit cards, ID badges, passports,
                  wallet apps on smartphones (like Google Pay), and more. A
                  contactless NFC scanner, like a Point-of-Sale (PoS) device, is
                  used to read the chip. This scanner communication connection
                  often requires the IoT device to be within 2 inches (6 cm) of
                  the scanner, but some NFC chips have an 8 inch (20 cm) range.
                  This short-distance range helps to limit wireless network
                  security threats. However, criminals can carry a portable NFC
                  scanner into a crowded area to pick up NFC chip data from
                  items like credit cards stored inside purses and wallets. To
                  protect against this type of data theft, the cards should be
                  placed inside special NFC/RFID sleeves that make the chips
                  unreadable until they are removed from the sleeves. NFC
                  technology may also be used in the pairing process for
                  Bluetooth connections.

              <h4>Ping: Internet Control Message Protocol</h4>
              When network problems come up, the most common issue you'll run
              into is the inability to establish a connection to something. It
              could be a server you can't reach at all, or a website that isn't
              loading. Maybe you can only reach your resource on your land and
              can't connect to anything on the Internet. Whatever the problem
              is, being able to diagnose connectivity issues is an important
              part of network troubleshooting. By the end of this lesson, you'll
              be able to use a number of important troubleshooting tools to help
              resolve these issues. When a network error occurs, the device that
              detects it needs some way to communicate this to the source of the
              problematic traffic. It could be that a router doesn't know how to
              route to a destination or that a certain port isn't reachable. It
              could even be that the TTL of an IP datagram expired and no
              further router hops will be attempted. For all of these situations
              and more, ICMP or Internet Control Message Protocol is used to
              communicate these issues. ICMP is mainly used by a router or
              remote host to communicate why transmission has failed back to the
              origin of the transmission. The makeup of an ICMP packet is pretty
              simple.
              <img src="image/2/6/icmp-packet.jpeg" alt="" />
              It has a header with a few fields and a data section that's used
              by a host to figure out which of their transmissions generated the
              error. The first field is the type field, eight bits long, which
              specifies what type of message is being delivered. Some examples
              are destination unreachable or time exceeded. Immediately after
              this is the code field which indicates a more specific reason for
              the message than just the type. For example, of the destination
              unreachable type, there are individual codes for things like
              destination network unreachable, and destination port unreachable.
              After this is a 16-bit checksum that works like every other
              checksum field we've covered so far. Next up is a 32-bit field
              with an uninspired name, rest of header. You think they could come
              up with something a bit more interesting, but I can't really think
              of anything good. Who am I to judge? Anyway, this field is
              optionally used by some of the specific types and codes to send
              more data. After this is the data payload for an ICMP packet.
              <img src="image/2/6/icmp-packet2.jpeg" alt="" />
              The payload for an ICMP packet exists entirely so that the
              recipient of the message knows which of their transmissions caused
              the error being reported. It contains the entire IP header and the
              first eight bytes of the data payload section of the offending
              packet. ICMP wasn't really developed for humans to interact with.
              The point is so that these error messages can be delivered between
              networked computers automatically. But there's also a specific
              tool and two message types that are very useful to human
              operators. This tool is called ping. Some version of it exists on
              just about every operating system and has for a very long time.
              Ping is a super simple program and the basics are the same no
              matter which operating system you're using. Ping lets you send a
              special type of ICMP message called an echo request. An ICMP echo
              request essentially just as a destination. Hey, are you there? If
              the destination is up and running and able to communicate on the
              network, it'll send back an ICMP echo reply message type. You can
              invoke the ping command from the command line of any modern
              operating system. In its most basic use, you just type ping and a
              destination IP, or a fully qualified domain name. Output of the
              ping command is very similar across each of the different
              operating systems. Every line of output will generally display the
              address sending the ICMP echo reply and how long it took for the
              round-trip communications. It will also have the TTL remaining and
              how large the ICMP message is in bytes.
              <img src="image/2/6/ping-windows.jpeg" alt="" />
              Once the command ends, there will also be some statistics
              displayed, like percentage of packets transmitted and received,
              the average round-trip time, and a couple of other things like
              that. On Linux and macOS, the ping command will run until it's
              interrupted by an end user sending an interrupt event. They do
              this by pressing the Control key and the C key at the same time.
              <img src="image/2/6/ping-mac-linux.jpeg" alt="" />
              On Windows, paying defaults to only sending four echo requests. In
              all environments, ping supports a number of command line flags
              that let you change its behavior, like the number of echo requests
              to send, how large they should be, and how quickly they should be
              sent. Check out the documentation for your operating system to
              learn a little bit more.

              <h4>Traceroute</h4>
              With Ping, you now have a way to determine if you can reach a
              certain computer from another one. You can also understand the
              general quality of the connection. But communications across
              networks especially across the internet usually cross lots of
              intermediary nodes.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/intermediate-routes.jpeg"
                alt="lots of
              intermediary nodes"
              />
              Sometimes, you need a way to determine where in the long chain of
              router hops the problems actually are. Traceroute to the rescue.
              Traceroute is an awesome utility that lets you discover the paths
              between two nodes, and gives you information about each hop along
              the way. The way Traceroute works is through a clever manipulation
              technique of the TTL Field at the IP Level. We learned earlier
              that the TTL Field is decremented by one by every router that
              forwards the packet. When the TTL Field reaches zero, the packet
              is discarded and an ICMP time-exceeded message is sent back to the
              originating host. Traceroute uses the TTL Field by first setting
              it to 1 for the first packet, then 2 for the second, 3 for the
              third and so on. By doing this clever little action, Traceroute
              makes sure that the very first packet sent will be discarded by
              the first router hop. This results in an ICMP time-exceeded
              message. The second packet will make it to the second router, the
              third will make it to the third and so on. This continues until
              the packet finally makes it all the way to its destination. For
              each hop, Traceroute will send three identical packets. Just like
              with Ping, the output of a Traceroute command is pretty simple. On
              each line, you'll see the number of the hop and the round trip
              time for all three packets.
              <img src="image/2/6/traceroute-command.jpeg" alt="" />
              You will also see the IP of the device at each hop and a host name
              if Traceroute can resolve one. On Linux and Mac OS, Traceroute
              sends UDP packets to very high port numbers. On Windows, the
              command has a shortened name tracert, and defaults to using ICMP
              echo requests.
              <img src="image/2/6/windows-traceroute.jpeg" alt="" />
              On all platforms, Traceroute has more options than can be
              specified using command line flags. Two more tools that are
              similar to Traceroute are mtr on Linux and Mac OS and pathping on
              Windows. These two tools act as long running trace routes. So you
              can better see how things change over a period of time. Mtr works
              in real time and will continually update its output with all the
              current aggregate data about the Traceroute. You can compare this
              with pathping, which runs for 50 seconds and then displays the
              final aggregate data all at once.

              <h4>Testing Port Connectivity</h4>
              We've covered a bunch of ways to test connectivity between
              machines at the network layer, but sometimes you need to know if
              things are working at the transport layer. For this, there are two
              super powerful tools at your disposal. Netcat on Linux and MacOS
              and Test-NetConnection on Windows. The Netcat tool can be run
              through the command nc and has two mandatory arguments, a host and
              a port. Running nc google.com 80 would try to establish a
              connection on port 80 to google.com. If the connection fails, the
              command will exit. If it succeeds, you'll see a blinking cursor
              waiting for more input.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/connection-port-80.jpeg"
                alt="connection on port 80 to google.com"
              />
              This is a way for you to actually send application layer data to
              the listening service from your own keyboard. If you're really
              only curious about the status of a port, you can issue the command
              with the -z flag, which stands for zero input output mode. The -v
              flag, which stands for verbose is also useful in this scenario.
              This makes the command output useful to human eyes as opposed to
              non verbose output, which is best for usage and scripts. Side
              note, verbose basically means talking too much. So, while I bet
              you want to throw up a flag on me and my jabbering, we still have
              lots to get through. Okay, so by issuing the Netcat command with
              the -z and -v flags, the command's output will simply tell you if
              a connection to the porting question is possible or not.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/netcat-command.jpeg"
                alt="issuing the Netcat command"
              />
              On Windows, Test-NetConnection is a command with some of the
              similar functionality. If you run Test-NetConnection with only a
              host specified, it will default to using an ICMP echo request,
              much like the program ping, but it will display way more data,
              including the data link layer protocol being used.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/test-net-command.jpeg"
                alt="Test-NetConnection command"
              />
              When you issue Test-NetConnection with the dash port flag, you can
              ask it to test connectivity to a specific port. It's important to
              call out that both Netcat and Test-NetConnection are way more
              powerful than the brief port connectivity examples we've covered
              here. In fact, there's such complex tools that covering all of
              their functionality would be too much for one video. You should
              read up about all of the other things these super powerful tools
              can do.

              <h4>Name Resolution Tools</h4>

              Name resolution is an important part of how the Internet works.
              Most of the time, your operating system handles all lookups for
              you. But as an IT support specialist, sometimes it can be useful
              to run these queries yourself so you can see exactly what's
              happening behind the scenes. Luckily, there are lots of different
              command line tools out there to help you with this. The most
              common tool is known as nslookup, and it's available on all three
              of the operating systems we've been discussing: Linux, Mac, and
              Windows. A basic use of nslookup is pretty simple. You execute the
              nslookup command with the host name following it, and the output
              displays what server was used to perform the request and the
              resolution result. Let's say you needed to know the IP address for
              twitter.com, you would just enter nslookup twitter.com and the a
              record would be returned. Nslookup is way more powerful than just
              that. It includes an interactive mode that lets you set additional
              options and run lots of queries in a row. To start an interactive
              nslookup session, you just enter nslookup without any host name
              following it. You should see an angle bracket acting as your
              prompt. From interactive mode, you can make lots of requests in a
              row. You can also perform some extra configuration to help with
              more in-depth troubleshooting. While in interactive mode, if you
              type server, then an address, all the following name resolution
              queries will be attempted to be made using that server instead of
              the default name server.
              <img src="image/2/6/ns-look-up.jpeg" alt="nslookup" />
              You can also enter set type equals followed by a resource record
              type. By default, nslookup will return A records, but this lets
              you explicitly ask for QWERTY or MX, or even text records
              associated with the host.
              <img src="image/2/6/ns-lookup2.jpeg" alt="nslookup" />
              If you really want to see exactly what's going on, you can enter
              set debug. This will allow the tool to display the full response
              packets, including any intermediary requests and all of their
              contents. Warning, this is a lot of data and can contain details
              like the TTL left if it's a cached response all the way to the
              serial number of the zone file the request was made against.

              <h4>Public DNS Servers</h4>

              Having functional DNS is an important part of a functional network
              in ISP almost always gives you access to a recursive name server
              as part of the service it provides. In most cases, these name
              servers are all you really need for your computer to communicate
              with other devices on the Internet. But most businesses also run
              their own DNS servers. In the very least, this is needed to
              resolve names of internal hosts. Anything from naming and
              computer, nais-laptop, to being able to refer to a printer by a
              name instead of an IP requires your own name server.
              <img src="image/2/6/own-dns.jpeg" alt="own name server" />
              A third option is to use a DNS as a service provider. It's getting
              more and more popular. No matter what DNS service model you're
              using on your network, it's useful to have a way to test DNS
              functionality in case you suspect something isn't working right.
              It can also be super useful to have a backup DNS option in case
              you experienced problems with your own. You might even be in the
              early stages of building out a new network and even if you plan to
              have your own name server, eventually, it may not be ready for
              use. Some internet organizations run what are called public DNS
              servers, which are name servers specifically set up so that anyone
              can use them for free. Using these public DNS servers is a handy
              technique for troubleshooting any name resolution problems you
              might be experiencing. Some people just use these name servers for
              all their resolution needs. For a long time, public DNS servers
              were a tribal knowledge passed down from one sysadmin to another.
              In ancient sysadmin lore, it's said that for many years the most
              commonly used public DNS servers, were those run by Level 3
              communications. One of the largest ISPs in the world. Level 3 is
              in fact so large. They mostly do business by selling connectivity
              to their network, to other ISPs that actually deal with consumers,
              instead of dealing with end-users themselves. The IP addresses for
              Level 3's public DNS servers are 4.2.2.1 through 4.2.2.6.
              <img src="image/2/6/public-dns-addresses.jpeg" alt="" />
              These IPs are easy to remember, but they've always been shrouded
              in a bit of a mystery. While they've been available for use by the
              public for almost 20 years now, it's not a service. Level 3
              officially has ever acknowledged or advertised, why? We might
              never know. It's one of the great mysteries of our ancient
              sysadmin lore. Anyway, other easy to remember options are the IPs
              for Google's public DNS. Google operates public name servers on
              the IPs, 8.8.8.8, and 8.8.4.4.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/google-public-dns.jpeg"
                alt="Google operates public name servers on
              the IPs"
              />
              Unlike the Level 3 IPs, these are efficiently acknowledged and
              documented by Google to be used for free by anyone. Most public
              DNS servers are available globally through anycast. Lots of other
              organizations also provide public DNS servers, but few are as easy
              to remember as those two options. Always do your research before
              configuring any of your devices to use that type of name server.
              Hijacking outbound DNS requests with faulty responses is an easy
              way to redirect your users to malicious sites.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/malicious-site.jpeg"
                alt="faulty responses is an easy
              way to redirect your users to malicious sites"
              />
              Always makes sure the name server is run by a reputable company
              and try to use the name servers provided by your ISP outside of
              troubleshooting scenarios. Most public DNS servers also respond to
              ICMP echo request, so there are a great choice for testing general
              Internet connectivity using ping. (Required) en ​

              <h4>DNS Registration and Expiration</h4>
              Refresher time. Remember that DNS is a global system managed in a
              tiered hierarchy with ICANN at the top level. Domain names need to
              be globally unique for a global system like this to work. You
              can't just have anyone decide to use any domain name, it'd be
              chaos. Enter the idea of a registrar, an organization responsible
              for assigning individual domain names to other organizations or
              individuals. Originally, there were only a few registrars. The
              most notable was a company named Network Solutions Inc. It was
              responsible for the registration of almost all domains that
              weren't country-specific. As the popularity of the internet grew,
              there was eventually enough market demand for competition in this
              space. Finally, the United States government and Network
              Solutions, Inc came to an agreement to let other companies also
              sell domain names. Today, there are hundreds of companies like
              this all over the world. Registering a domain name for use is
              pretty simple. Basically, you create an account with the
              registrar, use their web UI to search for a domain name to
              determine if it's still available, then you agree upon a price to
              pay and the length of your registration.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/domain-registration.jpeg"
                alt="registrar procedure"
              />
              Once you own the domain name, you can either have the registrar's
              name servers act as the authoritative name servers for the domain,
              or you can configure your own servers to be authoritative. Domain
              names can also be transferred by one party to another and from one
              registrar to another. The way this usually works is that the
              recipient registrar will generate a unique string of characters to
              prove that you own the domain and that you're allowed to transfer
              it to someone else. You'd configure your DNS settings to contain
              this string in a specific record, usually a text record. Once this
              information has propagated, it can be confirmed that you both own
              the domain and approve its transfer.
              <img src="image/2/6/domain-transfered.jpeg" alt="" />
              After that, ownership would move to the new owner or registrar. An
              important part of the domain name registration is that these
              registrations only exist for a fixed amount of time. You typically
              pay to register domain names for a certain number of years. It's
              important to keep on top of when your domain names might expire
              because once they do, they're up for grabs and anyone else could
              register them. (Required) en ​

              <h4>Hosts Files</h4>
              Long before DNS wasn't established and globally available
              technology, it was clear to computer operators that they needed a
              language-based system to refer to network devices. We've talked
              about how humans are way better at remembering descriptive words,
              than numbers. But numbers represent the natural way that computers
              think and communicate. The original way that numbered network
              addresses were correlated with words was through hosts files. A
              host file is a flat file that contains on each line a network
              address followed by the host name it can be referred to as. For
              example, a line in a host file might read 1.2.3.4 web server. This
              means that on the computer where this host file resides, a user
              could just refer to web server instead of the IP 1.2.3.4. Hosts
              files are evaluated by the networking stack of the operating
              system itself. That means the presence of an entry there would
              translate to anywhere you might refer to a networking address.
              Sticking with our earlier example, a user could type web server
              into a web browser URL bar, or could issue a ping web server
              command and it would get translated to 1.2.3.4 in either case.
              Hosts files might be ancient technology, but they've stuck around
              all this time. All modern operating systems, including those that
              power our phones and tablets, still have hosts files. One reason
              is because of a special IP address we haven't covered yet: the
              loopback address. A loopback address always points to itself. A
              loopback address is a way of sending network traffic to yourself.
              Sending traffic to a loopback address bypasses all network
              infrastructure itself and traffic like that never leaves the node.
              The loopback IP, for IPv4 is 127.0.0.1, and it's still to this day
              configured on every modern operating system through an entry in a
              host file, almost every host file in existence will in the very
              least contain a line that reads 127.0.0.1 localhost, most likely
              followed by::1 localhost, where::1 is the loopback address for
              IPv6. Since DNS is everywhere, host files aren't used much
              anymore, but they still exist and they're still important to know
              about. Some software even require specific entries in the host
              file to operate properly as antiquated as this practice may seem.
              Finally, host files are a popular way for computer viruses to
              disrupt and redirect users' traffic. It's not a great idea to use
              host files today, but they do have some useful troubleshooting
              purposes that can be helpful in IT support. Host files are
              examined before a DNS resolution attempt occurs on just about
              every major operating system. This lets you force an individual
              computer to think a certain domain name always points at a
              specific IP. Got it. We've covered a lot, so take time to go back
              if you need to and make sure you understand the concepts we're
              discussing.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>What is The Cloud?</h4>
              You've probably been hearing people talk about the cloud more and
              more. There are public clouds and private clouds and hybrid clouds
              and rain clouds but not really relevant here. There are cloud
              clients and cloud storage and cloud servers too. You might hear
              the cloud mentioned in newspaper headlines and TV advertisements.
              The cloud is the future, so we're told, and IT support specialists
              really need to keep up on the latest innovations in tech in order
              to support them. But what exactly is the cloud? The truth is the
              cloud isn't a single technology or invention or anything tangible
              at all. It's just a concept, and to throw in another cloud joke, a
              pretty nebulous one at that. The fact that the term 'the cloud'
              has been applied to something so difficult to define is pretty
              fitting. Basically, cloud computing is a technological approach
              where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way so
              that lots of users get what they need when they need it. It's an
              approach that leans heavily on the idea that companies provide
              services for each other using these shared resources. At the heart
              of cloud computing is a technology known as hardware
              virtualization. Hardware virtualization is a core concept of how
              cloud computing technologies work. It allows the concept of a
              physical machine and a logical machine to be abstracted away from
              each other. With virtualization, a single physical machine called
              a host could run many individual virtual instances called guests.
              An operating system expects to be able to communicate with the
              underlying hardware in certain ways. Hardware virtualization
              platforms employ what's called a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a
              piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines while
              also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's
              indistinguishable from actual hardware. With virtualization, a
              single physical computer can act as the host for many independent
              virtual instances.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/virtualisation.jpeg"
                alt="With virtualization, a
              single physical computer can act as the host for many independent
              virtual instances"
              />
              They each run their own independent operating system and, in many
              ways, are indistinguishable from the same operating systems
              running on physical hardware. The cloud takes this concept one
              step further. If you build a huge cluster of interconnected
              machines that can all function as hosts for lots of virtual
              guests, you've got a system that lets you share resources among
              all of those instances. Let's try explaining this in a more
              practical way. Let's say you have the need for four servers.
              First, you need an email server. You've carefully analyzed things
              and expect this machine will need eight gigs of RAM to function
              properly. Next, you need a name server. The name server barely
              needs any resources since it doesn't have to perform anything
              really computational. But, you can't run it on the same physical
              machine as your email server since your email server needs to run
              on Windows, and your name server needs to run on Linux. Now, the
              smallest server configuration your hardware vendor sells is a
              machine with eight gigabytes of RAM. So you have to buy another
              one with those specifications. Finally, you have a financial
              database. This database is normally pretty quiet and doesn't need
              too many resources during normal operations. But for your end of
              month billing processes to complete in a timely manner, you
              determine the machine would need 32 gigabytes of RAM. It has to
              run on a special version of Linux designed just for the database
              so the name server can also run on this machine. So you order a
              server with that much RAM and then a second with the same
              specifications to act as a backup. In order to run your business
              this way, you have to purchase four machines with a grand total of
              80 gigabytes of RAM.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/physical-machines.jpeg"
                alt="machines with a grand total of
              80 gigabytes of RAM"
              />
              That seems pretty outrageous since it's likely that only 40
              gigabytes of this total RAM will ever be used at one time. Most of
              the month you're using much less. That's a lot of money spent on
              resources you're either never going to use or rarely use. So let's
              forget about that model. Instead, let's imagine a huge collection
              of interconnected servers that can host virtualized servers. These
              virtual instances running on this collection of servers can be
              given access to the underlying RAM as they need it. Under this
              model, the company that runs the collection of servers can charge
              you to host virtual instances of your servers instead of you
              buying the four physical machines.
              <img src="image/2/6/cloud.jpeg" alt="virtual instances servers" />
              And it could cost much less than what you'd spend on the four
              physical servers. The benefits of the cloud are obvious. But let's
              take it a step further. The cloud computing company that can host
              your virtualized instances also offer dozens of other services. So
              instead of worrying about setting up your own backup solution, you
              can just employ theirs. It's easy. And if you need a load
              balancer, you can just use their solution. Plus, if any underlying
              hardware breaks, they just move your virtual instance to another
              machine without you even noticing. To top it all off, since these
              are all virtual servers and services, you don't have to wait for
              the physical hardware you ordered to show up. You just need to
              click a few buttons in a web browser. That's a pretty good deal.
              In our analogy, we used an example of what a public cloud is, a
              large cluster of machines run by another company. A private cloud
              takes the same concepts, but instead, it's entirely used by a
              single large corporation and generally physically hosted on its
              own premises. Another term you might run into, a hybrid cloud,
              isn't really a separate concept. It's just a term used to describe
              situations where companies might run things like their most
              sensitive proprietary technologies on a private cloud while
              entrusting their less sensitive servers to a public cloud. Those
              are the basics of what the cloud is. It's a new model in computing
              where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources
              available in a better way. The cloud lets you provision a new
              server in a matter of moments and leverage lots of existing
              services instead of having to build your own. To sum up, its blue
              skies ahead for anyone using their cloud. Sorry, I couldn't
              resist. (Required) en ​

              <h4>Everything as a Service</h4>
              In our last video, we gave you a basic definition of what cloud
              computing is, but the term has really come to mean so much more
              than just hosting virtual machines. Another term that's been used
              more and more with the rise of cloud computing is X as a service.
              Here, the X can stand for lots of different things. The way we've
              described the clouds so far, would probably best be defined as
              infrastructure as a service or IaaS. The idea behind
              infrastructure as a service is that you shouldn't have to worry
              about building your own network or your own servers. You just pay
              someone else to provide you with that service. Recently, we've
              seen the definition of the cloud expand well beyond infrastructure
              as a service. The most common of these are platform as a service
              or PaaS, and software as a service or SaaS. Platform as a service
              is a subset of cloud computing where a platform is provided for
              customers to run their services. This basically means that an
              execution engine is provided for whatever software someone wants
              to run. A web developer writing a new application doesn't really
              need an entire server, complete with a complex file system,
              dedicated resources and all those other things. It doesn't matter
              if this server is virtual or not, they really just need an
              environment that their web app can run in, that is what platform
              as a service provides. Software as a service takes this one step
              further, infrastructure as a service abstracts away the physical
              infrastructure you need, and platform as a service abstracts away
              the server instances you need. Software as a service is
              essentially a way of licensing the use of software to others while
              keeping that software essentially hosted and managed. Software as
              a service has become really popular for certain things. A great
              example is email, offerings like Gmail for business from Google or
              Office 365 Outlook from Microsoft are really good examples of
              software as a service. Using one of those services means you're
              trusting Google or Microsoft to handle just about everything about
              your email service. Software as a service is a model that's
              gaining a ton of traction. Web browsers have become so feature
              packed that lots of things that required standalone software in
              the past can now run well inside of a browser. And if you can run
              something in a browser, it's a prime candidate for SaaS today. You
              can find everything from word processors to graphic design
              programs, to human resource management solutions offered under a
              subscription based SaaS model. More and more, the point of a
              business's network is just to provide an internet connection to
              access different software or data in the cloud.

              <h4>IPv6 Addressing and Subnetting</h4>
              Time for some real talk. Here's the hard truth. The IANA is out of
              IP addresses. When IPv4 was first developed, a 32-bit number was
              chosen to represent the address for a node on a network. The
              Internet was in its infancy and no one really expected it to
              explode in popularity the way it has. Thirty-two bits were chosen,
              but it's just not enough space for the number of
              Internet-connected devices we have in the world. IPv6 was
              developed exactly because of this issue. By the mid-1990s, it was
              more and more obvious that we were going to run out of IPv4
              address space at some point, so a new Internet Protocol was
              developed. Internet Protocol version 6 or IPv6. You might wonder
              what happened to version 5 or IPv5. It's actually a fun bit of
              trivia. IPv5 was an experimental protocol that introduced the
              concept of connections. It never really saw wide adoption and
              connection state was handled better later on by the transport
              layer and TCP. Even though IPv5 is mostly a relic of history, when
              development of IPv6 started, the consensus was to not reuse the
              IPv5 name. The biggest difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the
              number of bits reserved for an address. While IPv4 addresses are
              32 bits, meaning there can be around 4.2 billion individual
              addresses, IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in size. The size
              difference is staggering once you do the math. Don't worry, we
              won't make you. Two to the power of 128 would produce a 39-digit
              long number. That number range has a name you've probably never
              even heard of, an undecillion. An undecillion isn't a number you
              hear a lot because it's ginormous, there really aren't things that
              exists at that scale. Some guesses on the total number of atoms
              that make up the entire planet earth and every single thing on it
              get into that number range. That should tell you we're talking
              about a very large number. If we can give every atom on Earth its
              own IP address, we'll probably be okay when it comes to network
              devices for a very long time. Just for fun, let's look at what
              that number actually looks like.
              <img src="image/2/6/ipv-6.jpeg" alt="39-digit number" />
              It looks like this. Wow, mind-blowing. Just like how an IPv4
              address is really just a 32-bit binary number, IPv6 addresses are
              really just 128-bit binary numbers. IPv4 addresses are written out
              in four octets of decimal numbers just to make them a little more
              readable for humans. But trying to do the same for an IPv6 address
              just wouldn't work. Instead, IPv6 addresses are usually written
              out as eight groups of 16 bits each. Each one of these groups is
              further made up of four hexadecimal numbers. A full IPv6 address
              might look something like this. That's still way too long, so IPv6
              has a notation method that lets us break that down even more. A
              way to show how many IPv6 addresses there are is by looking at our
              example IP. Every single IPv6 address that begins with 2001:0db8
              has been reserved for documentation and education or for books and
              courses just like this one.
              <img src="image/2/6/reserved-ip.jpeg" alt="reserved IPs" />
              That's over 18 quintillion addresses, much larger than the entire
              IPv4 address space reserved just for this purpose. There are two
              rules when it comes to shortening an IPv6 address. The first is
              that you can remove any leading zeros from a group. The second is
              that any number of consecutive groups composed of just zeros can
              be replaced with two colons. I should call out that this can only
              happen once for any specific address. Otherwise, you couldn't know
              exactly how many zeros were replaced by the double colons. For
              this IP, we could apply the first rule and remove all leading
              zeros from each group. This would leave us with this.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/ipv6-address-rools.jpeg"
                alt="replacing zeros by semicolons"
              />
              Once we apply the second rule, which is to replace consecutive
              sections containing just zeros with two colons, we'll end up with
              this. This still isn't as readable as an IPv4 address, but it's a
              good system that helps reduce the length a little bit.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/ipv6-rool2.jpeg"
                alt="replace consecutive
              sections containing just zeros with two colons"
              />
              We can see this approach taken to the extreme with IPv6 loopback
              address. You might remember that with IPv4, this address is
              127.0.0.1. With IPv6, the loopback address is 31 zeros with a one
              at the end, which can be condensed all the way down to just::1.
              <img src="image/2/6/ipv6-address.jpeg" alt="IPv6 address" />
              The IPv6 address space has several other reserved address ranges
              besides just the one reserved for documentation purposes or the
              loopback address. For example, any address that begins with FF00:
              : is used for multi-cast, which is a way of addressing groups of
              hosts all at once. It's also good to know that addresses beginning
              with FE80:: are used for link-local unicast. Link-local unicast
              addresses allow for local network segment communications and are
              configured based upon a host's MAC address. The link-local address
              are used by an IPv6 host to receive their network configuration,
              which is a lot like how DHCP works. The host's MAC address is run
              through an algorithm to turn it from a 48-bit number into a unique
              64-bit number. It's then inserted into the address's host ID. The
              IPv6 address space is so huge, there was never any need to think
              about splitting it up into address classes like we used to do with
              IPv4. From the very beginning, an IPv6 address had a very simple
              line between network ID and host ID. The first 64 bits of any IPv6
              address is the network ID, and the second 64 bits of any IPv6
              address is the host ID.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/host-id-network-id.jpeg"
                alt="network ID, and the second 64 bits of any IPv6
              address is the host ID"
              />
              This means that any given IPv6 network has space for over nine
              quintillion hosts. Still, sometimes network engineers might want
              to split up their network for administrative purposes. IPv6
              subnetting uses the same cider notation that you're already
              familiar with. This is used to define a sub-net mask against the
              network ID portion of an IPv6 address.

              <h4>IPv6 Headers</h4>
              When IPv6 was being developed, they took the time to introduce a
              few improvements instead of just figuring out a way to increase
              the address size, this should come as a relief to you and IT
              support specialists love networks that perform well. One of the
              most elegant improvements was made to the IPv6 header which is
              much simpler than the IPv4-1. The first field in an IPv6 header is
              the version field. This is a 4-bit field that defines what version
              of IP is in use.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/version-field.jpeg"
                alt="a 4-bit field that defines what version
              of IP is in use"
              />
              You might remember that an IPv4 header begins with this exact same
              field. The next field is called the traffic class field. This is
              an 8-bit field that defines the type of traffic contained within
              the IP datagram and allows for different classes of traffic to
              receive different priorities.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/trafic-class-field.jpeg"
                alt="trafic class field"
              />
              The next field is the flow label field. This is a 20-bit field
              that's used in conjunction with the traffic class field for
              routers to make decisions about the quality of service level for a
              specific datagram.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/flow-label-field.jpeg"
                alt="flow label field"
              />
              Next, you have the payload length field. This is a 16-bit field
              that defines how long the data payload section of the datagram is,
              <img src="image/2/6/payload-field.jpeg" alt="payload field" />
              then you have the next header field.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/next-header-field.jpeg"
                alt="next header field"
              />
              This is a unique concept to IPv6 and needs a little extra
              explanation. IPv6 addresses are four times as long as IPv4
              addresses. That means they have more ones and zeros which means
              that they take longer to transmit across a link. To help reduce
              the problems with additional data that IPv6 addresses impose on
              the network, the IPv6 header was built to be as short as possible.
              One way to do that is to take all of the optional fields and
              abstract them away from the IPv6 header itself. The next header
              field defines what kind of header is immediately after this
              current one. These additional headers are optional, so they're not
              required for a complete IPv6 datagram. Each of these additional
              optional headers contain a next header field and allow for a chain
              of headers to be formed if there's a lot of optional
              configuration. Next we have what's called the hop limit field.
              <img src="image/2/6/hop-limit-field.jpeg" alt="hop limit field" />
              This is an 8-bit field that's identical and purpose to the TTL
              field in an IPv4 header. Finally, we have the source and
              destination address fields which are each 128 bits.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/source-destination-field.jpeg"
                alt="source and
              destination address fields"
              />
              If the next header field specified another header, it would follow
              at this time. If not, a data payload, the same length as specified
              in the payload length field would follow.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/data-payload-field.jpeg"
                alt="payload length field"
              />
            </div>
            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>IPv6 and IPv4 Harmony</h4>
              It's just not possible for the entire Internet and all connected
              networks to switch to IPv6 all at once. There'll be way too much
              coordination at play. Too many old devices that might not even
              know how to speak IPv6 at all still requiring connections. The
              only way IPv6 will ever take hold is to develop a way for IPv6 and
              IPv4 traffic to co-exist at the same time. This would let
              individual organizations make the transition when they can. One
              example of how this can work is with what's known as IPv4-mapped
              address space. The IPv6 specifications have set aside a number of
              addresses that can be directly correlated to an IPv4 address. Any
              IPv6 address that begins with 80 zeros and is then followed by 16
              ones, is understood to be part of the IPv4-mapped address space.
              The remaining 32 bits of the IPv6 address is just the same 32 bits
              of the IPv4 address it's meant to represent.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/ipv4-ipv6.jpeg"
                alt="32 bits of the IPv6 address is just the same 32 bits
              of the IPv4 address"
              />
              This gives us a way for IPv4 traffic to travel over an IPv6
              network. But probably more important is for IPv6 traffic to have a
              way to travel over IPv4 networks. It's easier for an individual
              organization to make the move to IPv6 than it is for the networks
              at the core of the Internet too. While IPv6 adoption becomes more
              widespread, it will need a way to travel over the old IPv4
              remnants of the Internet backbone. The primary way this is
              achieved today is through IPv6 tunnels. IPv6 tunnels are
              conceptually pretty simple. They consist of IPv6 tunnels servers
              on either end of a connection. These IPv6 tunnels servers take
              incoming IPv6 traffic and encapsulate it within traditional IPv4
              datagrams. This is then delivered across the IPv4 Internet space,
              where it's received by another IPv6 tunnel server.
              <img
                src="image/2/6/ipv6-ipv4-2.jpeg"
                alt="IPv6 tunnels servers
              on either end of a connection"
              />
              That server performs the D encapsulation and passes the IPv6
              traffic further along the network. Along with IPv6 tunnel
              technologies, the concept of an IPv6 tunnel broker has also
              emerged. These are companies that provide IPv6 tunneling endpoints
              for you, so you don't have to introduce additional equipment to
              your network. There are a lot of competing protocols to be used
              for these IPv6 tunnels. Since this is still a new and evolving
              space, it's not clear who the winner will be. It doesn't really
              matter which tunneling technology ends up becoming the most common
              solution. It will probably fade away in time itself. The future of
              networking is the adoption of IPv6 as the main protocol at the
              network layer. One day we won't need any tunnels at all. The
              future is limitless and tunnel lists or something like that.
              You've done an amazing job getting through all this information,
              so take some time to pat yourself on the back. (Required) en ​

              <h4>Supplemental Reading for IPv6 and IPv4 Harmony</h4>
              <h5>IPv6 and IPv4 harmony</h5>
              <p>
                At the network layer of the TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model,
                nodes connect through the internet protocol (IP) and the IP
                addresses that come along with it. The most common version of IP
                is version four (IPv4), but version six (IPv6) is rapidly seeing
                more widespread adoption.
              </p>
              <p>
                This reading covers key differences between IPv6 and IPv4 and
                the methods that allow them to work together.
              </p>
              <p>
                When IPv4 was first developed, a 32-bit number was chosen to
                represent the address for a node on a network. This means there
                can be around 4.2 billion individual IPv4 addresses. But this
                just isn’t enough addresses for the number of Internet-connected
                devices we have in the world today. IPv6 was developed to
                provide plenty of addresses for all of our Internet connected
                devices. While IPv4 represents addresses with a 32-bit number,
                IPv6 represents addresses with 128 bits. This 128-bit update
                allows for a practically unlimited number of IPv6 addresses, 340
                trillion trillion trillion addresses to be exact!
              </p>
              <p>
                IPv4 and IPv6 require a different structure for each version’s
                datagrams. This means the IPv4 and IPv6 networks speak different
                languages. For IPv6 data to travel over an IPv4 network, the
                IPv6 datagram has to be translated into something IPv4 can
                understand. Since it's not possible for the entire Internet and
                all connected networks to switch to IPv6 all at once, IPv6
                tunneling protocols are used to allow IPv6 traffic to travel
                over the remaining IPv4 network.
              </p>
              <h5>Tunneling</h5>
              <p>
                Tunneling protocols allow users to carry IPv6 traffic across an
                IPv4 network. Tunnels are created using IPv6 servers on either
                end of a network connection. A tunnel server at one end takes
                incoming IPv6 traffic and encapsulates it within a traditional
                IPv4 datagram. Encapsulation is the process of transporting a
                data packet inside the payload of another packet.
              </p>
              <img src="image/2/6/tunneling.png" alt="tunneling" />
              <p>
                IPv6 data that’s encapsulated within an IPv4 datagram can then
                be delivered across the IPv4 network and received by another
                IPv6 tunnel server. The receiving server de-encapsulates the
                datagram and passes the IPv6 traffic further along the IPv6
                network.
              </p>
              <h6>Three types of tunnels</h6>
              <p>
                Since IPv6 tunneling is still an evolving technology, there are
                several competing protocols used to establish IPv6 tunnels. Here
                are three commonly used tunnel protocols:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>6in4/manual protocol</b> encapsulates IPv6 packets
                  immediately inside an IPv4 packet, without using additional
                  headers to configure the setup of the tunnel endpoints. Setup
                  is configured manually instead. This makes performance
                  predictable and easy to debug. Unfortunately, this protocol
                  often will not function if the host uses network address
                  translation (NAT) technology to map its IPv4 address. This
                  makes the 6in4/manual protocol difficult to deploy.

                  <b>Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP)</b> specifies rules for
                  negotiating the setup parameters between tunnel endpoints.
                  This allows for a variety of tunnel encapsulation methods and
                  wider deployment than is possible with the 6in4/manual
                  protocol.

                  <b>Anything in Anything (AYIYA)</b> protocol defines a method
                  for encapsulating any protocol in any other protocol. AYIYA
                  was developed for tunnel brokers, a service which provides a
                  network tunnel. This protocol specifies the encapsulation,
                  identification, checksum, security, and management operations
                  that can be used once the tunnel is established. A key
                  advantage of AYIYA is that it can provide a stable tunnel
                  through an IPv4 NAT. It allows users behind a NAT or a dynamic
                  address to maintain connectivity even when roaming between
                  networks.

              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, IPv6 traffic needs a way to
                travel over the IPv4 network.

                  Tunneling protocols allow users to carry IPv6 traffic across
                  an IPv4 network.

                <li>
                  Since IPv6 tunneling is still an evolving technology, there
                  are several competing protocols used to establish IPv6
                  tunnels.
