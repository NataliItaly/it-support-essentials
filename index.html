            <div class="article__part">
              <p>
                Computer technology has come a long way since the first computer
                was invented. Along the way, many people from diverse
                backgrounds contributed inventions and innovations that helped
                us get to where we are today with modern computers. Without
                these individuals, information technology would not be where it
                is today.
              </p>
              <h4>Early Computer Pioneers</h4>
              <h4>Ada Lovelace</h4>
              <p>
                Ada Lovelace was born in 1815 to Anna Milbanke and the poet Lord
                Byron. Her mother Anna Milbanke educated her to excel in
                mathematics. When Lovelace was still young, she was shown the
                <span title="">Difference Engine</span> (a mechanical calculator developed by Charles
                Babbage) and published a set of notes which contained the first
                computer algorithm for the Analytical Engine in 1843. Lovelace
                predicted at the time that computers would eventually be used
                outside of mathematics for things like composing music and made
                predictions about how technology would influence society.
              </p>
              <h4 class="article__secondary-title">Alan Turing</h4>
              <p>
                Alan Turing was born in 1912. While completing his degrees, he
                developed the concept of the Turing machine. Turing proved that
                there were some yes/no mathematical questions that could never
                be solved <span title=""> computationally</span> which defined computation and its
                limitations. These findings would go on to become one of the
                seeds of computer science and his conceptual Turing machine (so
                named by his Doctoral advisor) is considered a predecessor of
                modern computer programs. During the Second World War, Turing
                developed the Turing-Welchman Bombe which was used to decipher
                Nazi codes and intercept Nazi messages. After the war, Turing's
                Imitation Game (now known as the Turing test) was created as a
                means to evaluate the abilities of artificial intelligence.
              </p>
              <h4 class="article__secondary-title">Margaret Hamilton</h4>
              <p>
                Margaret Hamilton was born in 1936. While working in the
                meteorology department at the Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology, she developed software for predicting weather. Later
                Hamilton would go on to work on the software that was used in
                the NASA Apollo command and lunar modules. With her experience
                writing software, she wanted to ensure that this skill would get
                its due respect and coined the term “software engineering.”
                Culminating her experience working on the Apollo missions and
                moon landings, Hamilton formalized what she learned into a
                theory that would later become the Universal System Language.
              </p>
              <h4 class="article__secondary-title">Admiral Grace Hopper</h4>
              <p>
                Grace Hopper was born in 1906. During the Second World War, she
                joined the US Navy Reserve after taking a leave from her role as
                a mathematics professor at Vassar College. In the Navy, she was
                assigned the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard
                University where she worked on the programming team for the Mark
                I computer. After the war and her time at Harvard, she began
                working on more powerful computers and recommended that a
                programming language be developed that used English words rather
                than symbols. This concept would eventually become FLOW-MATIC
                the first programming language to use English words which also
                necessitated the invention of the first compiler (a program that
                translates source code into machine code). Notably, she is also
                credited with first using the term “computer bug” after a real
                bug (a moth) flew into a computer she was working on. Later in
                her career, she was one of the designers of COBOL, a programming
                language that is still in use today.

                <b>A computer simply compares 1s and 0s, but millions or billions
                of times per second. The communication that a computer
                uses is referred to as binary system, also known as base-2
                numeral system</b>. This means that it only talks in 1s and 0s. You
                may be thinking, okay, my computer only talks in 1s and 0s. How
                do I communicate with it? Think of it like this.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use the letters of the alphabet to form words and we give
                those words meaning. We use them to create sentences,
                paragraphs, and whole stories. The same thing applies to binary,
                except instead of A, B, C, and so on, we only have 0 and 1 to
                create words that we give meaning to. In computing terms, <b> we
                group binary into 8 numbers, or bits.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                Technically, a bit is a binary digit. Historically, we used 8
                bits because in the early days of computing, hardware utilized
                the base-2 numeral system to move bits around. 2 to the 8th
                numbers offered us a large enough range of values to do the
                computing we needed. Back then, any number of bits was used, but
                eventually the grouping of 8 bits became the industry standard
                that we use today.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Group of 8 bits is referred to as a byte.
              </p>
              <p>
                So a byte of zeroes and ones could look like 10011011. Each byte
                can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values,
                thanks to the base-2 system, 2 to the 8th. In computer talk,
                this byte could mean something like the letter C.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using binary, we can have unlimited communication with our
                computer. Everything you see on your computer right now, whether
                it's a video, an image, text or anything else, is nothing more
                than a 1 or a 0. It is important you understand how binary
                works. It is the basis for everything else we'll do in this
                course, so make sure you understand the concept before moving
                on.

                numbers, emojis and more we see on our screens, from only these
                256 possible values. It's all thanks to character encoding.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Character encoding is used to assign our binary values to
                characters so that we as humans can read them.
              </p>
              <p>
                We definitely
                wouldn't want to see all the text in our emails and Web pages
                rendered in complex sequences of zeros and ones. This is where
                character encodings come in handy. You can think of character
                encoding as a dictionary. It's a way for your computers to look
                up which human characters should be represented by a given
                binary value.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The oldest character encoding standard used this ASCII.
              </p>
              <p>
                It represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks.
                The first character in ASCII to binary table, a lowercase a,
                maps to 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 in binary. This is done for all the
                characters you can find in the English alphabet as well as
                numbers and some special symbols. The great thing with ASCII was
                that we only needed to use 127 values out of our possible 256.
                It lasted for a very long time, but eventually it wasn't enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other character encoding standards recreated to represent
                different languages, different amounts of characters and more.
                Eventually they would require more than 256 values we were
                allowed to have.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then came UTF 8. The most prevalent encoding
                standard used today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along with having the same ASCII table, it
                also lets us use a variable number of bytes. What do I mean by
                that? Think of any emoji. It's not possible to make emojis with
                a single byte, so as we can only store one character in a byte,
                instead UTF 8 allows us to store a character in more than one
                byte, which means endless emoji fun. UTF 8 is built off the
                Unicode Standard. We won't go into much of detail, but the
                Unicode Standard helps us represent character encoding in a
                consistent manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that we've been able to represent letters, numbers,
                punctuation marks and even emojis, how do we represent color?
                Well, there are all kinds of color models. For now, let's stick
                to a basic one that's used in a lot of computers. RGB or red,
                green, and blue model. Just like the actual colors, if you mix a
                combination of any of these, you'll be able to get the full
                range of colors. In computerland, we use 3 characters for the
                RGB model. Each character represents a shade of the color and
                that then changes the color of the pixel you see on your screen.
                With just eight combinations of zeros and ones, were able to
                represent everything that you see on your computer, from a
                simple letter a, to the very video that you're watching right
                now on the Coursera website.

              <h4>BINARY DATA</h4>
              <p>
                You might be wondering how our computers get these ones and
                zeros. It's a great question. Imagine we have a light bulb and a
                switch that turns the state of the light on or off. If we turn
                the light on, we can denote that state is one. If the light bulb
                is off, we can represent the state is zero. Now imagine eight
                light bulbs and switches, that represents eight bits with a
                state of zero or one. Let's backtrack to the punched cards that
                were used in Jacquard's loom.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that the loom used cards with holes in them. When the
                loom would reach a hole it would hooked to thread underneath,
                meaning that the loom was on. If there wasn't a hole, it would
                not hook the thread, so it was off. This is a foundational
                binary concept. By utilizing the two states of on or off,
                Jacquard was able to weave intricate patterns of the fabric with
                his looms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then the industry started refining the punch cards a little
                more. If there was a hole, the computer would read one. If there
                wasn't a hole, it would read zero. Then, by just translating the
                combination of zeros and ones, our computer could calculate any
                possible amount of numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Binary in today's computer isn't done by reading holes. It uses
                electricity via transistors allowing electrical signals to pass
                through. If there's an electric voltage, we would denote it as
                one. If there isn't, we would denote it by zero. For just having
                transistors isn't enough for our computer to be able to do
                complex tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine if you had two light switches on opposite ends of a
                room, each controlling a light in the room. What if when you
                went to turn on the light with one switch, the other switch
                wouldn't turn off? That would be a very poorly designed room.
                Both switches should either turn the light on or off depending
                on the state of the light. Fortunately, we have something known
                depending on logical conditions. There are lots of different
                types of <span title="">logic gates</span>, but we won't discuss them in detail here.

              <p>
                If you're curious about the role that transistors and logic
                gates play in modern circuitry, you can read more about it in
                the supplementary reading. Now we know how our computer gets its
                ones and zeros to calculate into meaningful instructions. Later
                in this course, we'll be able to talk about how we're able to
                turn human-readable instructions into zeros and ones that our
                computer understands through compilers. That's one of the very
                basic building blocks of programming that's led to the creation
                of our favorite social media sites, video games, and just about
                everything else.

              <h4>Logic Gates</h4>
              <p>
                Knowing how logic gates work is important to understanding how a
                computer works. Computers work by performing binary
                calculations. Logic gates are electrical components that tell a
                computer how to perform binary calculations. They specify rules
                for how to produce an electrical output based on one or more
                electrical inputs. Computers use these electrical signals to
                represent two binary states: either an “on” state or an “off”
                state. A logic gate takes in one or more of these binary states
                and determines whether to pass along an “on” or “off” signal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Several logic gates have been developed to represent different
                rules for producing a binary output. This reading covers six of
                the most common logic gates.
              </p>
              <h4>Six common logic gates</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h5>NOT gate</h5>
                  <p>
                    The NOT gate is the simplest because it has only one input
                    signal. The NOT gate takes that input signal and outputs a
                    signal with the opposite binary state. If the input signal
                    is “on,” a NOT gate outputs an “off” signal. If the input
                    signal is “off,” a NOT gate outputs an “on” signal. All the
                    logic gates can be defined using a schematic diagram and
                    truth table. Here’s how this logic rule is often
                    represented:
                  </p>
                  <img
                    src="image/1/logic-gate/logic-gate-not-gate.png"
                    alt="Not gate schema and truth table"
                  />
                  <p>
                    On the left, you have a schematic diagram of a NOT gate.
                    Schematic drawings usually represent a physical NOT gate as
                    a triangle with a small circle on the output side of the
                    gate. To the right of the schematic diagram, you also have a
                    “truth table” that tells you the output value for each of
                    the two possible input values.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>AND gate</h5>
                  <p>
                    The AND gate involves two input signals rather than just
                    one. Having two input signals means there will be four
                    possible combinations of input values. The AND rule outputs
                    an “on” signal only when both the inputs are “on.”
                    Otherwise, the output signal will be “off.”
                  </p>
                  <img
                    src="image/1/logic-gate/logic-gate-and-gate.jpeg"
                    alt="AND gate schema and truth table"
                  />
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>OR gate</h5>
                  <p>
                    The OR gate involves two input signals. The OR rule outputs
                    an “off” signal only when both the inputs are “off.”
                    Otherwise, the output signal will be “on.”
                  </p>
                  <img
                    src="image/1/logic-gate/logic-gate-or-gate.jpeg"
                    alt="OR gate schema and truth table"
                  />
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>XOR Gate</h5>
                  <p>
                    The XOR gate also involves two input signals. The XOR rule
                    outputs an “on” signal when only one (but not both) of the
                    inputs are “on.” Otherwise, the output signal will be “off.”
                  </p>
                  <img
                    src="image/1/logic-gate/logic-gate-xor-gate.jpeg"
                    alt="XOR gate schema and truth table"
                  />
                  <p>
                    The truth tables for XOR and OR gates are very similar. The
                    only difference is that the XOR gate outputs an “off” when
                    both inputs are “on” while the OR outputs an “on.” Sometimes
                    you may hear the XOR gate referred to as an “exclusive OR”
                    gate.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>NAND gate</h5>
                  <p>
                    The NAND gate involves two input signals. The NAND rule
                    outputs an “off” signal only when both the inputs are “on.”
                    Otherwise, the output signal will be “on.”
                  </p>
                  <img
                    src="image/1/logic-gate/logic-gate-nand-gate.jpeg"
                    alt="NAND gate schema and truth table"
                  />
                  <p>
                    If you compare the truth tables for the NAND and AND gates,
                    you may notice that the NAND outputs are the opposite of the
                    AND outputs. This is because the NAND rule is just a
                    combination of the AND and NOT rules: it takes the AND
                    output and runs it through the NOT rule! For this reason,
                    you might hear the NAND referred to as a “not-AND” gate.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5>XNOR gate</h5>
                  <p>
                    Finally, consider the XNOR gate. It also involves two input
                    signals. The XNOR rule outputs an “on” signal only when both
                    the inputs are the same (both “On” or both “Off”).
                    Otherwise, the output signal will be “off.”
                  </p>
                  <img
                    src="image/1/logic-gate/logic-gate-xnor-gate.jpeg"
                    alt="XNOR gate schema and truth table"
                  />
                  <p>
                    The XNOR rule is another combination of two earlier rules:
                    it takes the XOR output and runs it through the NOT rule.
                    For this reason, you might hear the XNOR referred to as a
                    “not-XOR” gate.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Combining gates (building circuits)</h4>
              <p>
                Logic gates are physical electronic components—a person can buy
                themand plug them into a circuit board. Logic gates can be
                linked together to create complex electrical systems (circuits)
                that perform complicated binary calculations. You link gates
                together by letting the output from one gate serve as an input
                for another gateor by using the same inputs for multiple gates.
                Computers are this kind of complex electrical system.

                Here’s a schematic drawing for a small circuit built with
                gates described above:

                alt="Combined circuit schematic"
              />
              <p>Here is the truth table for this circuit:</p>
              <img

                alt="Combined circuit truth table"
              />
              <p>
                This circuit uses three logic gates: an XOR gate, a NOT gate,
                and an AND gate. It takes two inputs (A and B) and produces two
                outputs (1 and 2). A and B are the inputs for the XOR gate. The
                output of that gate became the input of the NOT gate. Then, the
                output of the NOT gate became an input for the AND gate (with
                input A as the other). Output 1 is the output from the AND gate.
                Output 2 is the output from the XOR gate.

                Logic gates are the physical components that allow computers to

                  Logic gates represent different rules for taking one or more
                  binary inputs and outputting a specific binary value (“on” or

                <li>
                  Logic gates can be linked so that the output of one gate

              <h3  class="article__title">BINARY COUNTING</h3>
              <p>
                Binary is the fundamental communication block of computers, but
                it's used to represent more than just text and images. It's used
                in many aspects of computing like computer networking, which
                you'll learn about in a later course. It's important that you
                understand how computers count in binary. We've shown you simple
                lookup tables that you can use like the ASCII to binary table,
                but as an IT support specialist, whether you're working on
                networking or security, you'll need to know how binary works.
              </p>
              <p>
                So let's get started. You'll probably need a trusty pen and
                paper, a calculator, and some good old-fashioned brain power to
                help you in this video. The binary system is how our computers
                count using ones and zeros, but humans don't count like that.
                When you were a child, you may have counted using ten fingers on
                your hand. That innate counting system is called the decimal
                form or base-10 system. In the decimal system, there are 10
                possible numbers you can use ranging from zero to nine. When we
                count binary, which only uses zero and one, we convert it to a
                system that we can understand, decimal. 330, 250, 2, 40, 4
                million, they're all decimal numbers. We use the decimal system
                to help us figure out what bits our computer can use. We can
                represent any number in existence just by using bits. And we can represent this number just using ones and
                zeros.
              </p>
              <p>
                So how does that work? Let's consider these numbers: 128, 64,
                32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1. What patterns do you see? Hopefully,
                you'll see that each number is a double of the previous number
                going right to left. What happens if you add them all up? You
                get 255. That's kind of weird. I thought we could have 256
                values for a byte. The zero is counted as a value,
                so the maximum decimal number you can have is 255. What do you
                think the number is represented here? See where the ones and the
                zeros are represented. Remember, if our computer sees a one,
                then the value was on. If it sees a zero, then the value is off.
                If you add these numbers up, you'll get a decimal value. If you
                guessed 10, then you're right.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you didn't get it, that's okay too. Take another look. The 2
                and 8 are on, and if we add them up, we get 10. Let's look at
                our ASCII to binary table again. The letter h in binary is
                01101000. Now, let's look at an ASCII to decimal table. The
                letter h in decimal is 104. Now, let's try our conversion chart
                again. 64 plus 32 plus 8 equals 104. Look at that. The math
                checks out. Now, we're cooking. Wow! We've gone over all the
                essentials of the basic building blocks of computing and machine
                language. Next, you're going to learn how we build on top of
                this layer of computing to perform the task

              <h3  class="article__title">COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE</h3>
              <p>
                In the last video I mentioned that people don't need to
                understand how a computer works for them to use it, because
                abstraction makes things simpler for us. That's technically
                true, but since you're stepping into the world of IT, you do
                need to understand all the layers of a computer and how they
                work. It's essential that you understand how the different
                pieces interact so you can resolve any issue that may arise.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                A computer can be cut into four main layers:
              </p>
              <ol class="important">
                <li>
                  Hardware
                </li>
                <li>
                  Operating system
                </li>
                <li>
                  Software
                </li>
                <li>
                  Users
                </li>
              </ol>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>The hardware layer is made up of
                  the physical components of a computer</b>. These are objects you can
                  physically hold in your hand. Laptops, phones, monitors,
                  keyboards
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The operating system allows hardware to communicate with the
                  system</b>. Hardware is created by many different manufacturers. <span title="">The
                  operating system allows them to be used with our system,
                  regardless of where it came from</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The software layer is how we as humans interact with our
                  computers</b>. When you use a computer, you're given a vast amount
                  of software that you interact with, whether it's a mobile app, a
                  web browser, a word processor, or the operating system itself.
                  Later in this course, we'll learn how software is installed on
                  our systems, and how we interact with different types of
                  software. The last layer may not seem like it's part of the
                  system, but it's an essential layer of the computer
                  architecture, the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p><b>The user interacts with the computer and she can do more than
                    that</b>. She can operate, maintain, and even program the computer.
                  </p>
                  <p class="important">
                    The user layer is one of the most important layers we'll learn
                    about. When you step into the field of IT, you may have your
                    hands full with the technical aspects, but the most important
                    part of IT is the human element.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                By the end of the course, you'll also learn how to apply your
                knowledge of how a computer works to fix real world issues that
                can sometimes seem <span title="">random and obscure</span>. We'll do this by learning
                how to utilize problem solving tactics to identify issues and
                solutions.

              <h4>Introduction to Computer Hardware</h4>
              <p>
                Let's face it, computers are everywhere. You come into contact
                with them at home, work, the airport, the grocery store, you're
                using some type of computer to take this course.
              </p>
              <p>
                But for now, let's check out a typical desktop setup. Desktops
                are just computers that can fit on or under our desks.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Physical components, hardware: a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a desktop. Sometimes
                you might even add a webcam, speakers, or a printer set up
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see common connectors here, the power outlet here, and
                the common ports here.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Ports are connection points that we can
                connect devices to that extend the functionality of our
                computer.
              </p>
              <p> We have a port here
                to connect to a monitor, and a few ports here to plug your
                keyboard and mouse. There's another important one here for our
                network connection. With just these ports, we're able to have
                the basic functionality to browse the web and much more. Things
                look pretty similar in a laptop.
              </p>
              <p>
                A built-in monitor, And a
                keyboard. There are also physical components inside the laptop
                case that are hidden for portability. Once you figure out how
                one computer works, you can figure out how any other computer
                works.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                CPU or central processing unit, which is covered by this
                heat sink. You could think of the CPU as the brain of our
                computer. The CPU does all the calculations and data processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                It communicates pretty heavily with this component right here,
                RAM or Random Access Memory.
              </p>
              <p class="important">RAM is our computer's short-term
                memory. We use this component when we want to store data
                temporarily.
              </p>
              <p>Like let's say, you're typing something into a chat
                or a piece of text in a word processor. This information is
                stored in the RAM.  When we want to store anything in
                long-term memory, we use this component here, the hard drive.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Hard drive holds all of our data, which can include music,
                pictures, applications.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Motherboard, it holds everything in place and lets our components communicate
                with each other. It's the foundation of our computer. You can
                think of the motherboard as the body or circulatory system of
                the computer that connects all the pieces together.
              </p>
              <p class="important">Power supply, which converts
                electricity from our wall outlet onto a format that our computer
                can use.
              </p>
              <p>All these components make up most computers, even a mobile phone. While       it      might look very
                different from your laptop, a mobile phone just uses a smaller
                version of the hardware that we saw in the desktop and laptop
                today. Understanding how computer hardware works
                is a really helpful skill set in IT support, since an IT
                department maintains the hardware that a company uses. A solid
                understanding of these computer internals will come in handy
                when troubleshooting hardware related problems, and taking
                things apart to see how they work is just super fun.

              <h4>Programs, the CPU, and Memory</h4>
              <p class="important">
                Our computer can only communicate in binary, using
                ones and zeroes.
              </p>
              <p>Our computers speak in machine language, but we
                of course speak in human languages, like English, Spanish,
                Mandarin, Hindi. If we want to communicate
                with our machines, we have to have some translation dictionary.
                Well our computers have a
                built-in translation book. In this lesson, we'll dive deeper
                into how our computer translates the information we give it into
                instructions that it understands. Right now, you're probably
                using a web browser, music player, text editor or something else
                in your computer. We interact with these applications on a daily
                basis. They are referred to as Programs.
              </p>
              <p class="important">Programs are basic
                instructions that tell the computer what to do. We typically
                store programs on durable media like hard drives.
              </p>
              <p>You can think
                of programs like cooking recipes. We get these recipes all
                stored together in a cook book just like apps stored in a hard
                drive. Now we want to make a ton of food. So we hire a chef to
                follow our recipes and whip up something good. The faster our
                chef works, the more food she'll prepare. The chef is our CPU,
                she processes the recipes we send her and makes the food. Our
                chef works super fast, so fast that she can cook faster than she
                can read. So, we take copy of the recipes and put them into RAM.
                Remember that RAM is our computer's short-term memory. It stores
                information in a location our CPU can access faster than it
                could with our hard drive. Now we can give our chef one or two
                recipes at a time, instead of reciting the entire cookbook to
                her. Okay, now let's say I want to make a peanut butter and
                jelly sandwich. I see a pretty good recipe, and send it to our
                chef to make.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that our chef needs these instructions quickly, so I
                don't send her the entire recipe, I send her one line at a time.
                1, Get two slices of bread. 2, Put peanut butter on one slice.
                3, Put jelly on another slice. 4, Combine the two slices of
                bread. Now, let me throw one more thing at you. Our chef can
                only communicate with us in ones and zeroes. So instead of
                sending something readable, like the recipe for a peanut butter
                and jelly sandwich, we have to send her something like this. In
                reality, this process is a little more complicated.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Our CPU is
                constantly taking instructions and executing them. These
                instructions are written in binary.
              </p>
              <p>
                How do instructions travel around
                the computer? In our computer, we have something called the
                External Data Bus or EDB.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/1/2/2.1.external-databus.jpeg"
                alt="External Data Bus"
              />
              <p>
                It's nothing like a bus at all. <b>External Data Bus (EDB) is a row of wires that
                interconnect the parts of our computer, kind of the veins in our
                body</b>. When you send a voltage to one of the wires, we say the
                state of the wire is on, or represented by a 1. If there's no
                voltage, then we say that the state is off, represented by a 0.
                This is how we send around our ones and zeroes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The last lesson we talked about how transistors help us to send
                voltages. Now we know how our bits physically travel around
                computer. <b>The EDB comes in different sizes, 8 bit, 16 bit, 32,
                even 64</b>. Can you imagine if you had 64 wires going? You can move
                around a lot more data. Right now, were just going to stick with
                using an EDB with 8 bits in our examples. Sending 1 byte at a
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our CPU is receiving a byte and it needs to get to
                work. Inside the CPU there are components known as Registers.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Registers let us store the data that our CPU works with.
              </p>
              <p>
                If for
                example, our CPU wanted to add two numbers, one number would be
                stored in a register a. Another number would be stored in
                register b. The result of those two numbers would be stored in
                register c. Imagine the register is one of our chef's work
                tables. Since she has a place to work, she can start to cook. To
                do so she uses a translation book to translate her binary into
                tasks that she can perform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's jump back for a second. Remember that our programs are
                copied into RAM for the CPU to read.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                RAM is memory that is
                randomly accessed, allowing our CPU to read from any part of RAM
                as quickly as any other part.
              </p>
              <p>
                We don't actually send data from
                RAM over the EDB. There would be way to much stuff. RAM can hold
                millions, even billions, of rows of data. Despite our sandwich
                example, most of our recipes aren't simple at all. There can be
                thousands of lines long. We want to process them and we don't
                actually go in any particular order. Since we can only send one
                line of data through the EDB at the time, we need the help of
                another component, the <span title="">Memory Controller Chip</span> or MCC.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The MCC is
                a bridge between the CPU and the RAM. You can think of it, a
                nerve in your brain connecting to your memories. The CPU talks
                to the MCC, and says, hey, I need the instructions for step
                number three of this recipe. The MCC finds the instructions for
                step number three in RAM, grabs the data, and sends it through
                the EDB.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's another bus. There's nothing like a bus
                involved in the process called the Address bus.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Address bus connects the
                CPU to the MCC, and sends over the location of the data, but not
                the data itself. Then the MCC takes the address and looks for
                the data. And then data is then sent over the EDB.
              </p>
              <p>
                Believe it or not, RAM isn't the fastest way we can get more
                data to our CPU for processing. The CPU also uses something
                known as Cache.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Cache is smaller than RAM, but it let's us store
                data that we use often, and let's us quickly reference it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Think of RAM like a refrigerator full of food. It's easy to get into,
                but it takes time to get something out. On the flip side of
                that, Cache is like the stuff we have in our pockets. It's used
                to store recently or frequently accessed data.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                There are three
                different cache levels in a CPU, L1, L2, and L3. L1 is the
                smallest and fastest cache.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're interested in learning
                more about this, you can check out the supplemental reading I've
                included right after this video. So now we understand how our
                RAM interacts with our CPU. But how does our CPU know when the
                set of instruction ends, and a new one begins.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Our CPU has an
                internal clock that keeps its operations in sync. It connects to
                a special wire called Clock wire. When you send or receive data,
                it sends a voltage to that clock wire to let the CPU know it can
                start doing calculations. Think of our clock wires as the
                ticking of a clock. For every tick, the CPU does one cycle of
                operations. When you send a voltage to the clock wire, it's
                referred to as a clock cycle. If you have lots of data you need
                to process in a command. You need to run lots of clock cycles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Have you ever seen a CPU in the store and has something labeled
                3.4ghz, this number refers to the Clock speed of the CPU.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Clock speed of CPU is a maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a set
                in a certain time period. 3.40 gigahertz is 3.4 billion cycles
                per second.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's super fast. <b>But just because it can run at
                this speed, doesn't mean it does. It just means that it can't
                exceed this number</b>. Still, that number doesn't stop some people
                from trying. There's a way you can exceed the number of clock
                cycles on your CPU on almost any device.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Overclocking and it increases the rate of your CPU clock cycles
                in order to perform more tasks. This is commonly used to
                increase the performance in low-end CPUs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's say you're a
                gamer and you want to have better graphics and less lag while
                playing. You might want to overclock your CPU when you play the
                game, but there are cons to doing this, like potentially
                overheating your CPU. You can read more about overclocking in

              <h4>Supplemental Reading for CPUs</h4>
              <h6>CPU cache and overclocking</h6>
              <p>
                In this reading, you will learn about the various levels of
                cache for central processing units (CPUs) and how a CPU
                processes and executes instructions. Additionally, you will
                learn about overclocking CPUs to maximize processing speeds. IT
                Support professionals may use this information when purchasing,
                allocating, and/or configuring high-performance servers.
              </p>
              <h6>Cache</h6>
              <p class="important">
                Cache is a small amount of
                recently used data that is stored either on hardware or in
                software.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first time data is accessed, both the initial
                request for the data and the reply containing the data pass
                through multiple points on their journey. Depending on several
                variables, these points might include I/O devices, motherboard
                busses, RAM, cables, hard drives, applications, networks, the
                internet, cloud platforms, and more. If a computer needed to use
                these full paths everytime it tried to access data, the entire
                transaction could take a relatively long time. Cache speeds up
                this process by holding a local copy of the most recently
                accessed data in temporary storage.
              </p>
              <h6>CPU cache</h6>
              <p class="important">
                CPUs use a system of cache storage to help them quickly access
                data. A CPU cache is normally stored inside each core of the
                CPU.
              </p>
              <p>
                Older computers might store CPU cache in a transistor chip
                that is attached to the motherboard, along with a high-speed bus
                connecting the chip to the CPU.
              </p>
              <h6>CPU levels of cache</h6>
              <p>There are three levels of CPU cache memory:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Level 3 cache: L3 cache is the largest and slowest of CPU
                  cache. However, it is often twice as fast as RAM. L3 is the
                  first CPU cache location to store data after it is transferred
                  from RAM</b>. L3 cache is often shared by all of the cores in a
                  single CPU.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Level 2 cache: L2 cache holds less data than L3 cache, but it has faster access speeds. L2 holds a copy of the most recently
                  accessed data that is not currently in use by the CPU</b>. Each
                  CPU core normally has its own L2 cache.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Level 1 cache: L1 cache is the fastest and smallest of the
                  three CPU cache levels. L1 holds the data currently in use by
                  the CPU</b>. Each CPU core usually has its own L1 cache.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Overclocking a cpu</h6>
              <p class="important">
                Overclocking a CPU sets it to run at a higher CPU clock
                frequency rate than the manufacturer’s original specifications.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if a processor is labeled as having a 3.2 GHz base
                frequency rate, it may be possible to overclock the CPU to run
                at 3.5 GHz. <b>Achieving a higher CPU clock frequency rate means
                the CPU can process a higher volume of instructions per
                nanosecond, resulting in faster performance</b>. A computer user
                might want to overclock their CPU to improve sluggish speeds
                when performing processor-intensive tasks, like video editing or
                gaming.
              </p>
              <p>Overclocking a CPU’s frequency involves three variables:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>The base CPU clock frequency</b>, often measured in GHz.</li>
                <li>
                  <b>The core frequency</b>, which is calculated by multiplying the
                  base frequency by the CPU core multipliers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>The core voltage</b>, which needs to be increased in small
                  increments to meet the increasing power demand of the CPU
                  during the overclocking process.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Warnings on overclocking</h6>
              <p class="important">
                Overclocking the CPU can damage the computer if not configured
                properly. Operating a CPU at a higher speed can overheat the CPU
                and surrounding hardware, which can cause the computer system to
                fail. Additionally, overclocking the CPU can shorten the overall
                lifespan of the computer and void the computer’s warranty. It is
                better to avoid overclocking the CPU and instead purchase the
                appropriate CPU speed necessary to meet computing demands.
              </p>
              <h6>How to overclock a CPU safely</h6>
              <p>
                As an IT Support professional, you may be asked to overclock a
                CPU. There are steps you should follow to do this as safely as
                possible. <b>Always make sure that the requestor understands the
                risks of overclocking before agreeing to perform this procedure</b>.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Check if overclocking is supported:</strong> First,
                  make sure the CPU is a model that is unlocked for
                  overclocking. Not all CPUs can support overclocking, including
                  most laptop CPUs. Check the CPU manufacturer’s documentation
                  to determine if overclocking is possible for the CPU model.
                  Both Intel and AMD provide overclocking guides and tools for
                  supported CPU models (see below for links to these guides).
                  Additionally, check the documentation for the computer’s
                  motherboard model to ensure that it can support an overclocked
                  CPU.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Clean the inside of the computer:</strong> Turn off
                  and unplug the computer. While wearing an anti-static
                  wristband, open the computer and use compressed air to remove
                  any dust build-up that has accumulated. It is especially
                  important to remove any dust from around the CPU, fans, and
                  intake vents.

                  >
                  If the computer has a stock CPU cooler, it is most likely
                  insufficient for cooling an overclocked CPU. Replace the stock
                  CPU cooler with an advanced cooling system, like a liquid
                  cooling system.

              <h4>CPU</h4>
              <p>
                If someone asked you, calculate the square root of 5,439,493,
                would you do the math by hand? Unless you really love tedious
                Math problems, you'd probably use a calculator. What about
                binary? Well, you probably wouldn't calculate binary by hand
                either. There's actually a very powerful calculator right inside
                of your computer that processes binary for us. We've already
                discussed this calculator in detail. Do you know what it is?
                It's our CPU, the brain of our computer. In this video, we'll
                cover the more practical aspects of the CPU. Remember that
                translation book that I talked about in an earlier lesson? The
                CPU uses this to translate and perform functions on our data.
                This translation book is called an instruction set, which is
                literally just a list of instructions that our CPU is able to
                run. Functions like adding, subtracting, copying data are all
                instructions that our CPU can carry out.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Every single program on your computer, while extremely complex,
                is broken down into very small and simple instructions found in
                our instruction set. Instruction sets are hard-coded into our
                CPU. So different CPU manufacturers may use different
                instructions sets. But they generally perform the same
                functions.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's like how car manufacturers build their engines
                differently but they all get the same job done. You probably
                work with computer hardware as an I.T. support specialist,
                replacing failed hard disks, upgrading RAM modules, and
                installing video cards. So you need to be aware of what's out
                there.
              </p>
              <p>
                You've probably heard of a few popular CPU manufacturers or
                chipsets like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm. These CPU manufacturers
                use different part names to differentiate their processors. Like
                Intel Core i7, AMD Athlon, Snapdragon 810, Apple A8, and more.
                Now, when you hear these terms, you'll know what they mean. Each
                of these CPU manufacturers have their strengths and weaknesses.
                If you're interested in learning more about why some CPUs are
                more popular than others, you can check out the next
                supplemental reading. <b>When you select your CPU, you need to make
                sure it's compatible with your motherboard</b>. The circuit board
                that connects all your components together.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can't just buy a bunch of parts and expect them to work
                together. There are different ways CPUs fit on motherboards
                using different <span title="">sockets</span>. Your CPU might have lots of tiny pins
                that either stick out or have contact points that look like
                dots. Depending on your motherboard, you need to make sure these
                CPUs fit correctly in the socket.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                There are currently two major
                types of CPU sockets, Land Grid Array also known as LGA, and Pin
                Grid Array, also known as PGA. In an LGA socket, like this one,
                there are pins that stick out of the motherboard. The socket
                size may vary.
              </p>
              <p>
                So <b>always make sure you CPU and socket are compatible before
                hand</b>. When you purchase the CPU or motherboard, they will tell
                you right on the box what type of socket it has. Make sure your
                CPU and motherboard socket also both match. If it's not listed
                on the box, you can go to the manufacturer's website where it
                usually list what types of CPUs are compatible with the
                motherboard. The other type of socket is the PGA socket, where
                the pins are located on the processor itself. <b>When we install
                our CPU, we need to do a few things to it to keep it cool. Since
                it does a lot of work, it's prone to overheating</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have to make sure to include a heat sink, too, which takes
                the heat from our CPU and dissipates it through a fan or another
                medium. There's one last thing I want to call out about CPUs. If
                you purchase a CPU, you'll see that it has either a 32 bit or 64
                bit architecture. What does that mean? Well, we know we can
                process 8 bits in binary. Now, imagine how we can process with
                32 or even 64 bits.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                CPUs that have 32 bit or 64 bit architecture
                are just specifying how much data it can efficiently handle.
              </p>
              <p>
                You
                can read more about the differences between 32 bit and 64 bit
                architecture in the next reading. For now, the main takeaway is
                that the CPU is one of the most important parts of a computer.
                So we have to make sure it's compatible with all other
                components and can perform well for our computing needs.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Upgrading from the 32-bit version to the 64-bit version of
                Windows requires that you reformat your hard disk, install the
                64-bit version of Windows, and then reinstall everything else
                that you had on your device.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>To install a 64-bit version of
                Windows, you need a CPU that's capable of running a 64-bit
                version of Windows</b>. The benefits of using a 64-bit operating
                system are most apparent when you have a large amount of random
                access memory (RAM) installed on your computer, typically 4 GB
                of RAM or more.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system
                can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a
                32-bit operating system, a 64-bit system can be more responsive
                when running several programs at the same time and switching
                between them frequently.

              <h4>RAM- short term memory</h4>
              <p>
                Let's talk about <b>RAM, our computers' short term memory</b>. We use
                RAM to store data that we want to access quickly. This data
                changes all the time so it isn't permanent. Almost all RAM is
                volatile, which means that <b>once we power off our machines, the
                data stored in RAM is cleared</b>. Remember that our <span title="">computer is
                comprised of programs</span>. <b>To run a program, we need to make a copy
                of it in RAM so our CPU can process it</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                When you see a new phone
                or laptop that's says it has 16 gigs of RAM, that means it can
                run up to 16 gigs of programs, meaning you can run lots of
                programs at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you type in a document, you're using RAM. If you've ever
                had the misfortune of working on an important presentation of
                paper and losing power, you know the feeling you get when all of
                the work you've done is lost. This happens because <b>RAM clears it's data</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are lots of types of RAM. And the one is commonly found in
                computers, is <b>DRAM or dynamic random access memory</b>. Where a one
                or zero is sent to DRAM, it stores each bit in a microscopic
                <span title="">capacitor</span>. This is either the charge or discharge represented by
                one or zero. These semiconductors are put into chips that are on
                the RAM and store our data. There are also different types of
                memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on. The more modern
                DIMM sticks, which usually stands for Dual Inline Memory Module,
                have different sizes of pins on them. I should call out, we
                don't really buy RAM based on the number of DRAM chips they
                have. They are labeled by the capacity of RAM on a stake, like
                an 8 gig stick of RAM.
              </p>
              <p>
                After DRAM was created, RAM manufacturers
                build something called <b>SDRAM which stands for Synchronous DRAM</b>.
                This type of RAM is synchronized to our systems' clock speed
                allowing quicker processing of data.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>In today's system, we use
                another type of RAM, called double data rate SDRAM, or DDR SDRAM
                for short</b>. Most people refer to this RAM as DDR, even shorter.
                There were lots of iterations of DDR, from DDR1, DDR2, DDR3 and
                now, DDR4. DDR is faster, takes up less power, and has a larger
                capacity than earlier SDRAM versions. The latest version, DDR4,
                is the fastest type of short term memory currently available for
                your computer. And <b>faster RAM means that programs can be run
                faster and that more programs can run at the same time</b>. Keep in
                mind that any RAM sticks you use need a compatible motherboard
                with a different number of pins aligned with the motherboard RAM
                slots. <b>Just like with the CPU, make sure that your motherboard
                is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy</b>. Up next, we'll
                take a deep dive into motherboards.

              <h4>Motherboard</h4>
              <p class="important">
                The <span class="important_word">motherboard</span>, the foundation that holds our computer
                together. It lets us expand our computers functionality by
                adding expansion cards. It routes power from the power supply,
                and it allows the different parts of the computer to communicate
                with each other. In short, it's a total boss.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every motherboard
                has a few key characteristics:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>First is the <span title="">chipset</span>, which
                  decides how components talk to each other on our machine.
                  The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips. One is
                  called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and
                  video cards. The other chip is the Southbridge, which maintains
                  our IO or input-output controllers, like hard drives and USB
                  devices, that input and output data. In some modern CPUs, the
                  Northbridge has been directly integrated into the CPU so there
                  isn't a separate Northbridge chip set.
                  </p>
                  <p class="important">
                    The <span class="important_word">chipset</span> is a key
                    component of our motherboard that allows us to manage data
                    between our CPU, RAM, and peripherals.
                  </p>
                  <p class="important">
                    <span class="important_word">Peripherals</span> are the external devices we     connect to our computer,
                    like a mouse, keyboard, and the monitor.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the
                    chipsets, motherboards have another key characteristic which
                    allows the use of <span title="">expansion slots</span>. <span   class="important_word">Expansion slots</span> also give us
                    the ability to increase the functionality of our computer. If
                    you wanted to upgrade your graphics card, you could purchase one
                    and just install it on your motherboard through the expansion
                    slot. <b>The standard for an expansion bus today is the PCI Express
                    or Peripheral Component Interconnect express. A PCIe bus looks
                    like a slot on the motherboard and a PCIe base expansion card
                    looks like a smallest circuit board</b>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The last component of motherboards that we'll discuss is <span title="">form
                      factor</span>. There are different size of motherboards that are
                    available today. These sizes of <span class="important_word">form factors</  span> determine the
                      amount of stuff we can put in it and the amount of space we'll
                      have. <b>The most common form factor for motherboards is ATX, which
                    stands for Advanced Technology Extended</b>. ATX actually comes in
                    different sizes too. In desktops, you'll commonly see full-sized
                    ATXs. If you don't want to use an ATX form factor, you could use
                    an IT or information technology extended form factor. These are
                    much smaller than ATX boards. For example, the Intel NUC uses a
                    variation of the ATX board, which comes in three board sizes;
                    mini ITX, nano ITX, and pico ITX.

                When building your computer, you will need to keep in mind what
                type of form factor you want. Do you want to build something
                small that can't handle as much workload, or do you want a
                powerhouse workstation that you can add lots of functionality
                to? The form factor will also play a role into what expansion
                slots you might want to use. Understanding motherboards and
                their characteristics can be a big plus one fixing hardware
                issues since things like the type of RAM module or processes
                socket are dependent on the kind of motherboard they need to fit
                into. Let's say you're responding to a ticket for a user who's
                having video problems, you don't want to make it all the way to
                their desk only to realize the graphics card you bought as a
                replacement doesn't fit the motherboard their computer uses.

              <h4>Physical Storage: Hard Drives</h4>
              <p>
                Before we get into computer storage, we need to fill in some
                gaps. <b>Gigabytes, bits: these terms refer to data sizes.</b>
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The smallest unit of a
                data storage is a bit. A bit can store one binary digit, so it
                can store a one or a zero.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Byte, which is comprised of eight bits. A single byte
                can hold a letter, number or symbol.
              </p>
              <p class="important_word">
                The next largest unit is
                referred to as a KB bite. But we typically use the term
                kilobyte. A kilobyte is made up of 1,024 bytes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's a quick
                data conversion chart. How much does 500 gigabyte even mean?
                Let's take a look at the size of an average music file, which is
                about three megabytes. On a 500 gigabyte machine, that's
                approximately 165,000 music files.

                Have you ever had an issue with your computer and
                lost all the data that was on your hard drive? Yeah, me too. It
                was the worst. This actually happens a lot and you'll probably
                encounter it as an IT support specialist. <b>Make sure you backup
                your data to be safe. This means you should copy or save your
                data somewhere else just in case something goes wrong and your
                hard drive crashes</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two basic hard drive types used today. Hard disk
                drives or HDDs uses a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to
                read and write information. The speed that the platter rotate
                allows you to read and write data faster. This is commonly
                referred to as RPM or revolution per minute. A hard drive with a
                higher RPM is faster. So if you go out and buy a hard drive
                today, you might see something like a 500 gigabyte, with 5,400
                rpm. <b>HDDs are prone to a lot more damage because there are a lot
                of moving parts</b>. This susceptibility to damage went away with a
                new type of storage called solid state drive or SSD. <b>SSDs have
                no moving parts</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Are you familiar with a USB stick? SSDs operate in a similar
                way. The information is stored on microchips and data travels a
                lot faster than HDDs. The form factor for SSDs is also slimmer
                compared to their HDD cousins. So why
                doesn't everyone use SSDs? Well, both have their pros and cons.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                HDDs are more affordable, but they're more prone to damage.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                SSDs
                are less risky when it comes to losing data, but they're also
                more expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                So you may not buy as much memory storage in
                SSDs than what you can get in HDDs.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are even hybrid SSD and HDD drives out
                there. They offer SSD performance where you need it for things
                like system performance, such as putting your computer along
                with hard disk drives, but less important stuff like basic file
                storage.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a few interfaces that hard drives use to
                connect our system. ATA interfaces are the most common ones. The
                most popular ATA drive is a Serial ATA or SATA, which uses one
                cable for data transfers. SATA drives are <span title="">hot swappable</span>. It means you don't have to turn off your
                machine to plug in a SATA drive. <b>SATA drives move data faster
                and use a more efficient cable like this one than its
                predecessors</b>. SATA has been the de facto interface for HDDs
                today. But people quickly found that using the SATA cable wasn't
                good enough for some of the blazing fast SSDs that were coming
                on the market. The interface couldn't keep up with the speeds of
                the newest SSDs.
              </p>
              <p>
                So another interface standard was created
                called NVM express, or NVMe. Instead of using a cable to connect
                your drive to your machine, the drive was added as an expansion
                slot, which allows for greater <span title="">throughput</span> of data and increased
                efficiency.

              <h4>Supplemental Reading for Data Storage</h4>
              <h5>Data Storage Measurements</h5>
              <p>
                In this reading, you will learn about the different names for
                measurements of data storage capacities and file sizes. Data
                storage capacity increases in step with the evolution of
                computer hardware technology. Larger storage capacities allow
                for dynamic growth in file sizes. These advances make it
                possible for companies like Netflix and Hulu to store thousands
                of feature-length films in high video quality formats. There are
                standardized sets of terms used to name the ever expanding sizes
                of data storage and files. For example, <b>the common terms used to
                describe file sizes and hard drive storage capacity include:
                bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes</b>. However,
                if you are a computer engineer, you might use a different set of
                terms.

              <p>Data storage measurement nomenclature</p>
              <img
                src="image/1/2/decimal-table.png"
                alt="Table illustrating decimal values for data storage measurements"
              />
              <p>
                <strong>Decimal nomenclature:</strong> kilobyte, megabyte,
                gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte, exabyte, zettabyte, yottabyte
              </p>
              <p>
                The decimal naming system for computer storage uses the metric
                system of prefixes from the International System of Units: kilo,
                mega, giga, tera, peta, exa, zetta, and yotta. These prefixes
                may also be referred to as the decimal system of prefixes. The
                metric/decimal nomenclature represent a base-10 approximation of
                the actual amount of data storage bytes. The metric system
                prefixes were selected to simplify the marketing of computer
                products.

                measurements"
              />
              <p>
                <strong>Binary nomenclature:</strong> kibibyte, mebibyte,
                gibibyte, tebibyte, pebibyte, exbibyte, zebibyte, yobibyte
              </p>
              <p>
                The binary naming system is a standard set by the International
                Organization for Standardization (ISO) in partnership with the
                International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The ISO 80000
                and IEC 80000 guides to units of measurement define the
                International System of Quantities (ISQ). The prefixes kibi-,
                mebi-, gibi, -tebi-. pebi-, exbi-, zebi-, and yobi- were created
                by the IEC organization. They are a blend of the first two
                letters of the metric prefix fused with the first two letters of
                the word “binary” (example: megabyte + binary + byte= mebibyte).
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Binary measurements of computer data are more accurate than
                decimal system measurements. While decimal nomenclature is
                commonly used to market computers and computer parts to the
                general public, binary nomenclature is often used in computer
                engineering for numerical accuracy.

              <h5>Quantities of storage measurements</h5>
              <p>
                As data storage grows, the need for new terminology to describe
                the exponentially larger byte quantities grows too. The current
                byte nomenclature, mathematical representations, and storage
                capacities are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  One bit: Also called a binary digit, bits store an electric
                  signal as 1. The absence of an electric signal is stored as 0,
                  which is also the default value of a bit. One bit can store
                  only one value, either 1 or 0. These two possible values are
                  the basis of the binary number system (base-2) that computers
                  use. All numbers in a base-2 system increase exponentially as
                  powers of 2.
                </li>
                <li>
                  One byte: One byte stores eight bits of ones and zeros that
                  translate to a symbol or basic computer instruction. Examples:
                  01101101 is the byte that translates to the letter “m.” The
                  byte 01111111 tells the computer to delete the character to
                  the right of the cursor.

              <h4>Power Supplies</h4>
              <p>
                In order to get our computer to work, let's give it some power.
                Computers have a power supply that converts electricity from
                your wall to something usable. <b>There are two types of
                electricity DC or direct current which flows in one direction
                and AC or alternating current which changes directions
                constantly. Our computers use DC voltage so we have to have a
                way to convert the AC voltage from our power company to
                something we can use</b>. That's what our power supply does. It
                converts the A C we get from the wall into low voltage DC power
                that we can use and transmit throughout our computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                To understand electricity, let's use
                the example of water pipes. Our tanks have a faucet that's
                connected to a pressurized water tank. When we turn on the
                faucet, water comes out. This is sort of how electricity works,
                when we plug in appliance into a wall outlet and turn it on, a
                flow electricity comes out. If we added more pressure to our water tank, would more water come out of it? The higher the pressure, the more water there
                will be.
              </p>
              <p>
                When it comes to electricity, we refer to the pressure
                as voltage. So, when I was on vacation to my surprise, when I
                plugged in the 120 volt appliance into a 220 volt outlet, the
                power came <span title="">bursting through</span> and fried my charger. If it was the
                other way around and a 220 volt appliance was plugged into 120
                volt outlet, I wouldn't have seen the same outcome. I'll still
                be able to get electricity, but slowly. This would be similar to
                if a water tank was only half pressurized it will draw water but
                slowly, in some cases though, this can deteriorate the
                performance of the device and cause damage in the long-term. As
                a general rule, <b>be sure to use the proper voltage for your
                electronics. We refer to the amount of electricity coming out as
                current or amperage and it's measured in amps</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can think of amps as pulling electricity as opposed to
                voltage, which pushes electricity. Amps will pull as much
                electricity needed, but voltage will just give you everything.
                Look on the back of one of your device charges. <b>You might see
                something like1 or 2.1 A, charging a device with 2.1 amps will
                actually charge a device faster because it's able to put more
                current from a 2.1 amp than a 1 amp charger</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Finally, the other
                important part of the electricity that you'll need to know is
                the wattage. Wattage is the amount of volts and amps that the
                device needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>If your power supply has too low the wattage, you won't be able
                to power your computer</b>, so make sure you have enough. This
                doesn't mean that if you have a large power supply you will
                overpower your computer. Power supplies just give you the amount
                that your system needs. It's best to err on the side of large
                power supplies, you can power most basic desktops with a 500
                watt power supply. But if you're doing something more demanding
                on your computer like playing a high resolution video game or
                doing a lot of video production and rendering, you will likely
                need a bigger power supply for your computer. On the other hand,
                if all you're doing is just browsing the web, the power supply
                that comes with your computer should be fine. All kinds of
                issues are caused by a bad power supply. Sometimes the computer
                doesn't even turn on at all, since power supplies can fail for
                lots of reasons like burnouts, power surges or even lightning
                strikes. Knowing how to diagnose power issues and replace a
                failed power supply is a skill every IT support specialist
                should have in their toolbox.

              <h4>Supplemental reading on power supply</h4>
              <p>
                In this reading, you will learn how to select the correct power
                supply for a personal computer (PC) to support the main
                components of the PC. As you learned in a previous video,
                <b>computer systems require a direct current (DC) of electricity to
                operate</b>. However, power companies deliver electricity in
                alternating currents (AC). AC power can damage the internal
                components of a computer. To solve this problem, computer power
                supplies are used to convert the AC from the wall socket to DC.
                Power supplies also reduce the voltage delivered to the
                computer’s internal components.
              </p>
              <h5>Computer architecture</h5>
              <p class="important">
                Computer architecture refers to the engineering design of
                computers and the interconnecting hardware components that
                together create computing devices that meet functional,
                performance and cost goals. Power supplies are part of the
                hardware layer of a computer’s architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                You learned earlier
                about the other major hardware components of a computer’s
                architecture, including the motherboard, chipsets, CPUs, RAM,
                storage, peripherals, expansion slots and cards, etc. These
                components influence the size and type of power supply a
                computer needs.
              </p>
              <h5>Selecting a power supply</h5>
              <p>
                Local input voltage A main consideration when selecting a
                computer power supply is the voltage delivered to common wall
                sockets in your country. Power standards for input voltages can
                vary from country to country. <b>The most common voltage inputs are
                110-120 VAC and 220-240 VAC</b>. VAC stands for volts of alternating
                current.
              </p>
              <p>
                Voltages in the Americas North, Central, and parts of South
                America use the 110-127 VAC standard for common wall sockets.
                Computers and power supplies sold in these regions are designed
                to use this level of power.
              </p>
              <p>
                Voltages for most of the world Most countries use the 220-240
                VAC standard for common wall sockets. Computers and power
                supplies sold in these areas are designed to use this higher
                voltage.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>It is important to use the correct voltage power supply or power
                converter for the computer’s voltage specifications</b>. Imagine
                that you have a customer who imported a PC from a country that
                uses a different standard for input voltage. You will need to
                adapt the input power to protect the computer. Some options for
                doing this might include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Replace the power supply with a unit that uses the appropriate
                  voltage for the target country.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Install a power supply model that includes a dual-voltage
                  switch that can be toggled from 110-120VAC to 220-240VAC.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Plug the computer into an external power converter that then
                  plugs into a normal wall socket. Power converters can be
                  purchased from any store that sells international travel
                  merchandise.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Without a power converter, the following problems may be
                experienced:

              <p class="important">
                The internal hardware components of a computer require varied
                input voltages to operate. Voltage regulators embedded in the
                motherboard of the computer control the amount of power that is
                delivered to the computer’s various internal components.

                The computer’s power supply <span title="">plugs</span> into an adapter on the
                computer’s motherboard. <b>The wiring for this connection uses
                color coded wires. Each wire color carries a different voltage
                of electricity to the motherboard or serves as a grounding wire.</b>
                A standard ATX motherboard power adaptor has either <span title="">20-pins</span> or
                24-pins to connect these wires. The 20-pin design is an older
                technology. The 24-pin connector was developed to provide more
                power to support additional expansion cards, powerful CPUs, and
                more. The 24-pin connector has become the standard for today’s
                personal computer power supplies and motherboards.

              <p class="important">
                The power supply will have multiple connectors that plug into
                the motherboard, hard drives, and graphic cards. Each cable has
                a specific purpose and delivers the appropriate amount of
                electricity to the following parts:

              <h4>Mobile devices</h4>
              <p class="important">
                Mobile devices are computers too, they have CPUs, RAM, storage,
                power systems and peripherals.
              </p>
              <p>
                How are they different from a
                server, a desktop computer or a laptop? There are special
                because they're mobile. They're portable and usually powered by
                batteries. Some mobile devices are general purpose computing
                devices, like tablets or smartphones. Other mobile devices are
                optimized to perform a specific set of tasks, like fitness
                monitors, e-readers, and smartwatches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mobile devices are usually very integrated. Remember the systems
                that we showed you earlier, the components can be taken out and
                held in your hand. Mobile devices build some or all of these
                components together in a way that you can't take apart. The
                smaller device, the more integrated the components usually are.
                The CPU, RAM, and storage might be soldered directly to the
                devices motherboard. Very small mobile devices use a system on a
                chip or SOC.
              </p>
              <p>
                A system on a chip packs the CPU, RAM and sometimes even the
                storage onto a single chip. Not only our SOC is small, they use
                less battery power than if those components were separated. Even
                though they're small some mobile devices use peripherals.
                Smartphones connect to Bluetooth headphones, for example. Mobile
                devices can also be a peripheral. A fitness tracker is a
                standalone device, but it can also be a peripheral to your
                smartphone. That same fitness tracker might use a heart rate
                monitor as a peripheral. It's peripherals all the way down.
                Mobile devices may use standard or proprietary ports and
                connectors.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might need to have a specific adapter or connector for
                charging a device or connecting your mobile device to a
                computer. Sometimes the physical shape or the intended use of
                the mobile device makes a standard connection like USB, a bad
                choice. For example, say you have a waterproof fitness tracker.
                If it had a micro-USB for, that port will be damaged if exposed
                to water. So instead, it's designed with a custom charging
                interface that can be submerged underwater. Here are some of the
                standard power data and display connector types you'll find used
                in mobile devices. This is a USB-C, next we have a lightening
                adapter, then a mini USB, and a micro-USB, a micro HDMI, and the
                mini HDMI, and this is a mini display port.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of mobile devices are generally small and have limited
                access to power, they run operating systems and application
                software that specifically designed to maximize their
                performance. As an IT support specialist, you
                might be responsible for helping end-users with their mobile
                devices. This might include setup, troubleshooting, repairing,
                and replacing mobile devices. Don't worry, we're going to break
                all this down for you. One super important thing, mobile devices
                can contain a lot of personal data. Some organizations allow
                people to use their own personal devices for work. We call this
                bring your own device or BYOD. You should be careful to respect
                people's privacy when they bring their own devices to you for
                help. To know how to handle these devices is always best to
                refer to your organization's policy.

              <h4>Batteries and Charging Systems</h4>
              <p>
                Sometimes instead of being plugged into a power outlet all the
                time, we want to take our technology with us. Mobile technology
                uses rechargeable batteries to carry power with the device
                wherever we take it. Rechargeable devices might have an external
                charger for removable batteries, or might have a <span title="">cradle stand</span> or
                wireless charger. Look at this phone, we can top up the battery
                just by laying it on this wireless inductive charging pad. Isn't
                that cool? It's also pretty clever technology. Rechargeable
                batteries have a limited lifespan, which is measured in charge
                cycles.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                A charge cycle is one full charge and discharge of a battery.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a battery is reaching the end of its <span title="">lifespan</span>, it may take
                longer to charge and might not hold as much charge as when it
                was new. For some devices, you compare the current cycle count
                of your battery with the rate at cycle count of that battery
                type, to see how much more life to expect out of it. You need an
                external power source to add power to a battery. This could come
                from a wall outlet, another battery, or even a solar panel. You
                also need a charging circuit that manages the power transfer
                from the external power source to the rechargeable battery. This
                circuit works a lot like a power supply unit or PSU that we
                looked at earlier. It makes sure the input power is converted to
                the correct output power. Instead of using a large PSU,
                rechargeable devices use more portable power adapters, power
                supplies or chargers.
              </p>
              <p>
                A portable power supply powers the device while also charging
                the battery. This might sound obvious, but you need to make sure
                that you use the right charger for the right device. Mismatching
                chargers to devices can damage the battery, the device and the
                charger. A lot of chargers and power supplies use USB
                connectors, but you'll see a wide variety of charging
                connectors. Rechargeable batteries can be damaged by very cold
                or very hot environments. Don't charge or discharge rechargeable
                batteries unless they're within their safe operating temperature
                range. Its not just that a damaged rechargeable battery might
                not perform well, it can also be very dangerous. Batteries can
                swell, <span title="">rupture</span>, and sometimes even catch fire. Before working
                with a damaged battery, you should know how to safely handle it.
                When a battery reaches the end of its life, you'll need to
                replace it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some devices will slow themselves down when a battery is getting
                old to make the battery last longer. If your device is running
                much slower than usual or shutting down unexpectedly, one thing
                to check is the battery life. Some devices have batteries that
                are designed to be replaced by the end-user. Other devices have
                batteries that are very difficult to replace, like small laptops
                and mobile devices. As an IT support specialist, you might
                receive special training on how to replace batteries and devices
                that you support. Or you might be the person sending the device
                out for battery replacement and then returning the device to the
                end-user.
              </p>
              <p>
                IT support specialist often have to troubleshoot battery life
                and device charging. The first step is to make sure the charger,
                the battery and the device are all designed to work with each
                other. We'll talk about sending out devices for repair and
                troubleshooting skills in future videos, so stay tuned. For iOS
                and Android, there are also some things that you could do to
                make the battery last as long as possible. It's a good idea for
                you to be familiar with these things so that you can help
                educate end-users on the best ways to get the most out of their
                mobile devices.

              <h4>Peripherals and Ports</h4>
              <p>
                Let's take a look at the back of our computer again. Here you
                see lots of connectors or ports we can plug in different
                objects, like a mouse, keyboard, and a monitor. These are known
                as peripherals.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                A peripheral is basically anything that you
                connect your computer externally that adds functionality.
              <p>
                You've
                probably used USB devices before. USB, also known as universal
                serial bus devices, are the most popular connections for our
                gadgets. USB has gone through lots of changes since <span title="">inception</span>.
                Your most commonly encounter USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and 3.1 in
                today's system.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the chart let's pay attention to the details using Mb/s
                instead of using MB to reference transfer speed, these are
                actually different units. MB is megabyte or unit of data storage
                while capital Mb/s is a megabit per second, which is a unit of
                data transfer rate.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/periferals1.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                <b>People often mistake speeds of 40 megabit a second to mean that
                you can transfer 40 megabytes of data per second. Remember that
                one byte is eight bits, so to transfer a one megabyte file in a
                second, you need an eight megabits per second connection speed</b>.
                You will also need compatible USB ports to go with your devices.
                If you connect a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 port, you won't
                get 3.0 transfer speed but you can still use the port since it's
                backward compatible, meaning older hardware will work with newer
                hardware.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/periferals2.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                The ports are easy to differentiate, let me show you. In
                general, USB 2.0 are black and USB 3.0 are blue and 3.1 ports
                are teal. This may change depending on manufacturers. There are
                lots of types of USB connectors and you can read about all of
                them in the supplemental reading right after this video, check
                it out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most recent USB connector is a Type C
                connector, which is meant to replace many peripheral
                connections. It's quickly becoming a universal standard for
                display and data transfer. In addition to USB peripherals, you
                should also be aware of display peripherals. There are some
                common impulse standards to know. Most computer monitors will
                have one or more of these connections, but you might encounter
                some older standards too, DVI. DVI cables are generally just
                output video, if you need to hook up a monitor or projector for
                a slide presentation, and you want audio too, you may be out of
                luck, instead, you want to look at one of the following cables,
                HDMI. This has become a standard in lots of televisions and
                computers nowadays, and outputs both video and audio. Another
                standard that's become popular among manufacturers is a display
                port, which also outputs audio and video. In addition to audio
                and video, USB Type C can also do data transfer and power. As an
                IT support specialist, you'll work with peripherals like USB
                devices and display devices a lot. Now, you'll be able to
                distinguish between the major types.

              <h4>Supplemental Reading on Connector Types</h4>
              <h5>Connector types</h5>
              <p>
                A computer has many physical ports or connectors. You can use
                these connectors to connect devices that add functionality to
                your computing, such as a keyboard, mouse, or monitor. These
                external devices are called peripherals. IT often works with and
                troubleshoots these peripherals, so it is helpful to understand
                the types of connectors. This reading will cover different types
                of connectors and their uses.
              </p>
              <h5>USB Connectors</h5>
              <p>USB 2.0, 3.0 & 3.1</p>
              <p>
                USB connectors transfer data and power to devices connected to a
                computer. USB connectors are the most popular connectors for all
                types of peripherals.
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/1/2/1.connector-types-usb.png"
                alt="USB Connectors"
              />
              <p>
                There are three generations of USB type A connectors in use
                today: USB 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1. Here are the differences between
                the three generations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  USB 2.0: Black port on the computer, 480 Mbps transfer speed
                </li>
                <li>USB 3.0: Blue port on computer, 5 Gbps transfer speed</li>
                <li>
                  USB 3.1: Teal port on the computer, 10 Gbps transfer speed
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                USB ports are backwards compatible, meaning a USB port can
                connect any of the three generations of USB type A connectors.
                The connected cable will determine the speed of data transfer.
                Connecting a USB 3 to a USB 2 port will result in 480 megabits
                (Mbps) per second of speed.
              </p>
              <h5>Micro USB, USB-C & Lightning Port</h5>
              <p>
                Micro USB, USB-C, USB4 (Thunderbolt), and Lightning Ports are
                smaller connectors that carry more power than older USB
                connectors and have faster data transfer speeds. These
                connectors are used for devices like smartphones, laptops, and
                tablets.

                  Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) refers to cables
                  transmitting voice through twisted copper pair wires. Landline
                  telephones, dial-up internet, and alarm systems use POTS. The
                  RJ-11 (Register Jack 11) connector is used for POTS.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) provides access to high-speed
                  networks or the internet through telephone lines and a modem.
                  The RJ-45 connects a computer to network elements and is
                  mostly used with ethernet cables.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cable Internet uses a cable TV infrastructure and a modem to
                  provide high-speed internet access to users. An F type
                  connector is commonly used with cable modems..
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fiber-optic cables contain strands of glass fibers inside an
                  insulated casing that send data long-distance and allow for
                  higher-bandwidth communication. The major internet providers
                  use fiber-optic cables for high-speed internet service.

              </ul>
              <h5>Device Connectors</h5>
              <p>
                IT professionals will encounter legacy devices that still use
                older connectors such as DB89 and Molex.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  DB89 connectors are used for older peripherals like keyboards,
                  mice, and joysticks. An IT professional may still encounter a
                  DB89 connector for external tools a computer uses and should
                  recognize the cable to connect to the appropriate port.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Molex connectors provide power to drives or devices inside the
                  computer. Molex connectors are used for connecting a hard
                  drive, disc drive (CD-ROM, DVD, Blu-ray), or a video card.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Punch Down Blocks</h5>
              <p>
                A punch down block is a terminal strip used to connect telephone
                or data lines. Punch down blocks are a quick and easy way to
                connect wiring. IT professionals use punch down blocks to change
                a wire or make a new connection for a telephone system or Local
                Area Network (LAN).

              <h4>BIOS</h4>
              <p>
                Okay, now we've seen all the key components to get our computer
                running. The last thing we'll go over is how our devices talk to
                each other. We know how programs execute from our hard drive to
                our CPU, but how do other things like a mouse click or a
                keyboard press get sent to our CPU for processing? These are
                fairly basic devices, they don't contain any instructions that
                our CPU knows how to read.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you just clicked on the key from your keyboard, you'd only be
                sending a byte to the CPU. The CPU doesn't know what this is,
                because it doesn't have instructions on how to deal with it.
                Turns out our devices also use programs to tell the CPU how to
                run them. These programs are <b>called services or drivers</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The
                drivers contain the instructions our CPU needs to understand
                external devices like keyboards, webcams, printers. Our CPU
                doesn't know that there is a device that it can talk to, so it
                has to connect to something called the BIOS, or basic input
                output services. The BIOS is software that helps initialize the
                hardware in our computer and gets our operating system up and
                running.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike the programs, you're probably used to running a web
                browser or operating system.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The BIOS isn't stored on a hard
                drive. Our motherboard stores the BIOS in a special type of
                memory called, the read-only memory chip, or ROM chip.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike RAM, <b>ROM is non-volatile, meaning it won't erase the data
                if the computer is turned off</b>. Once the operating system loads,
                we're able to load drivers from non-essential devices, directly
                from the hard drive.
              </p>
              <p>
                In today's system, <b>there is another player
                for BIOS called UEFI, which stands for Unified Extensible
                Firmware Interface. UEFI performs the same function of starting
                your computer as a traditional BIOS</b>. But it's more modern and
                has better compatibility and support for newer hardware. Most
                hardware out there today comes with UEFI built in. Eventually,
                UEFI will become the predominant BIOS.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                When you turn on a
                computer, you might notice a beeping from time to time. How
                computers run a test to make sure all the hardware is working
                correctly. This is called a Power On Self Test or POST. And then
                BIOS runs it when you <span title="">boot up your computer</span>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The POST figures out what hardware is on the computer. So it
                happens before the BIOS initializes any hardware or loads up
                essential drivers. If there is an issue with anything at that
                point, there is no way to display it on the screen, since things
                like the video driver haven't been loaded. Instead, the computer
                can usually produce a series of beeps, almost like Morse code,
                which will help identify the problem. Different manufacturers
                have different beep codes. So, if your computer successfully
                boots up, you may hear a single beep.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>If you hear two beeps, it could mean a POST error</b>. It's best to
                refer to your motherboard manual to find out what each code
                means. Also, you should know that not all machines have built-in
                speakers, so don't worry if your computer boots without a beep.
                If it does have a built-in speaker, being able to distinguish
                what <b>the beep codes mean is an extremely helpful tool when
                  troubleshooting boot issues</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                One last thing, we will discuss are
                BIOS settings. There is <b>a special chip on our motherboard called
                the CMOS chip. It stores basic data about booting your computer like the date,
                time and how you wanted to start up</b>. You can change these
                settings by booting into CMOS or BIOS setting menu. It varies in
                different computers, but usually when you boot the computer,
                there will be a quick screen that tells you what button to push
                to get into the settings. From there, you can change the basic
                BIOS settings of your machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                An an IT support role, you might interact with the BIOS more
                often than you think. BIOS settings control which devices to
                boot to and in an IT role, you might need to change the settings
                more often than not. A frequently performed IT task is the
                reimaging of a computer. The term refers to a disk image which
                is a copy of an operating system. So the process of reimaging
                involves wiping and reinstalling an operating system. This
                procedure is typically performed using a program that's stored
                on some external device like a USB memory stick, or a CD ROM, or
                even a server accessible through the network. To access these
                programs and perform the reimage, you'll need to use the BIOS to
                tell the computer to boot up from that external device.

              <h4>Putting it All Together: Installing The Processor</h4>
              <p>
                Now that we've learned what the computer components are and how
                they work, we're going to assemble our very own computer, a
                full-sized desktop. Computers are incredibly fundamental to the
                work of an IT support specialist. They're used in pretty much
                every aspect of the job. Aside from work, knowing how to build a
                computer might inspire you to try all kinds of cool stuff. You
                could custom build a gaming rig to play the most advanced game
                at the highest settings, or like me, make a home media server
                for all your photos and videos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing how to build a computer is a skill that can be useful in
                lots of interesting ways. Before we get started, let's lay down
                some ground rules for this ground-up build. <b>We should think about electrostatic discharge and
                try to prevent unwanted static from harming our very expensive
                components</b>. Have you ever rubbed your socks on a carpet then
                accidentally zap someone? That's pretty harmless. But if you do
                that to your new motherboard, you could completely destroy it.
                How do we prevent static discharge? We can go about this in two
                ways. You can touch an electrical device that's plugged in but
                not powered on. You should do this every couple of minutes
                when assembling a new computer. Another option is to wear an
                anti-static wristband, like the one I have here.
              </p>
              <p>
                You connect the end of the clip to a non painted metal service
                like your computer and then you strap it on to your hands, and
                you're done. While we're on the subject of anti-static safety, I
                want to call out that <b>when you buy computer parts, they'll come
                in anti-static bags to prevent accidental static electricity. Be
                sure to keep them inside the bags until you need to install them
                on your computer</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now, let's get making this computer. We'll start by laying down
                the foundation of our computer. The motherboard. Remember, there
                are lots of different form factors for motherboards and you want
                to make sure the one new purchase fits your computer case. We
                purchased a full-sized desktop case and have a full sized ATX
                motherboard. The motherboard, there are lots of screw holes
                which coincide with the holes in the desktop case too. You want
                to match up the holes on the motherboard to the holes on the
                desktop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you figure out which holes to use, <span title="">screw in the standoffs</span>.
                Standoffs are used to raise and attach your motherboard to the
                case. In this instance, our case has built-in standoffs. Let's
                start by adding our components in. We'll start with the CPU.
                Let's take that out of our anti-static bag. You want to be very
                careful with these because they're very expensive and you don't
                want to drop them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once we've taken out the bag, let's lineup the CPU with the
                motherboard socket. Something to note is this marker right here.
                This has to align with the CPU socket on the motherboard. Also,
                don't forget to make sure you get compatible CPUs that fit your
                motherboard. We have the LGA CPU in the LGA compatible
                motherboard socket. Let's go ahead and align the correct
                orientation of the CPU and secure it in place like this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like I mentioned before, you want to make sure that the pointers
                on the CPU and the socket are aligned. The easy part is putting
                a CPU in, the fun part is securing this. Just note that when you
                secure the CPU in the socket, you do need to use a bit of force
                so it's tightly secured in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now the CPU is secured in the socket. Now that our CPU
                is in place, we need to add our heat sink on top of it. The heat
                sink is used to <span title="">dissipate</span> heat from our CPU. I'll show you some
                cool things. This part right here, this is what our CPU relies
                on to stay cool. It takes the heat from there and then uses this
                fan to blow it out. Before we attach the heat sink, we need to
                apply an even amount of thermal paste. Let me get that. This is
                the thermal paste. Thermal paste is used to better connect our
                CPU and heat sink, so the heat transfers from one to the other
                better. To get started, apply a dab of thermal paste and spread
                it evenly with a flat object. Let's do that on our CPU right
                here. The first thing that you want to do is slowly apply a slat
                dab on the CPU, like so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then with a flat object apply the thermal paste evenly
                throughout your CPU to go halfway right here, halfway right
                here, halfway right here, and then halfway right here. Just make
                sure that it spread evenly throughout the CPU. You may have to
                do this multiple times to get this correct.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have that in place, you're going to take your heat sink
                and then you're going to press it against the CPU. Something to
                note is these screws right here. They align with the CPU socket
                so they can guide you while you put the heat sink on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have all four sockets aligned, go ahead and get
                your screwdriver and then tighten down the sockets. One thing to
                do is to make sure that you screw opposite sides first so you
                know that the heat sink is attached securely. One thing I like
                to do again is just to go over my screws to make sure everything
                is tightened securely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that our screws are tightly on and our heat sink is
                secured to the CPU, you have to plug this molex to the
                motherboard. This is important because this is what controls the
                fan speed via the motherboard. Perfect. Now you've fully
                installed and connected your CPU to the motherboard.

              <h4>Adding the Ram and the Drive</h4>
              <p>
                Let's install our RAM, locate the DIMM slots on your
                motherboard. So, these are the DIMM slots like we discussed
                before, I have four slots available here and I have four RAM
                sticks, lemme pick those up, that's my RAM sticks and of course
                they're my anti static bag. Just take them out.
              </p>
              <p>
                So as mentioned before this build, we're going to use DDR3 RAM.
                All right, one thing I like to do before I install my RAM is to
                make sure that I align these slots with my RAM slots, so that
                way I'm not going to be forcing those in when it's time to
                install. So, if you see right here, you start to align in the
                middle. So something I do is before I put it in, just visually
                make sure that you got this right, then align the rest of your
                RAM sticks to the same position, like this. Sort of go like
                this, like this and like this, that way you're not going to be
                damaging your pins if you pick your RAM sticks up and
                accidentally force it in.
              </p>
              <p>
                So now we've got that, we're going to put this in this slot
                right here. Line up the pins correctly and pushing the RAM until
                you hear click. You know it's secure when both sides of the RAMs
                are locked in place. And there's something else you should know,
                your slots right here, they're both black and white. We're going
                to stick to using the white slots. There's two and we're also
                going to put this one right here.
              </p>
              <p>
                There you go, you've securely fastened your RAM inside your
                motherboard. Next, we have our hard drive in this example, we're
                using an SSD SATA hard drive instead of HDD, we just need to use
                one SATA cable to connect it to our motherboard. So first, I'm
                going to go ahead and slot this in this cage. This is going to
                vary from case to case, but this one's going to be easy, all we
                had to do was just slide it in like so and normally you'll hear
                it click, like that. Once that's in, we just need to use one
                SATA cable to connect our SSD to our motherboard. Lemme go and
                get that.
              </p>
              <p>
                So here we go, here's a SATA cable. So what I'm going to do is
                I'm going to connect this end to our SSD, I'm going to connect
                this end to our motherboard. There we go, it's in. Remember,
                SATA cables can only go in one way. So now that we have our SSD
                installed, let's go ahead and install our case fan.
              </p>
              <p>
                And this is how this looks like. One thing to note is a small X,
                you're going to go ahead and find a label on your motherboard
                that says rear fans. Not all motherboards have this, but in this
                example we do have that, so just to note. <span title="">Get those into the
                grooves</span>, there you go, my fan's installed and now I'm going to
                go ahead and attach this to the more AX, there we go. Now my fan
                is attached to my motherboard. The best practice you want to
                create a wind tunnel that takes an air, blows it over your
                components and then pushes it all out back.
              </p>
              <p>
                Check out how our heat sink has a fan on it too. That's pretty
                normal since our CPU generates a lot of heat and we want to help
                cool it off as best as we can. We're almost done, now we're
                going to connect our power and test to see if everything's
                working. So let's grab our power supply. Here we are. First,
                let's secure our power supply to our case. Be careful not to
                damage the motherboard when you install it, what you're going to
                do is you're going to put this in slowly like that and then just
                slide it in, there you go. One thing I like to do is I like to
                put my cables all the way up to the side, so like I mentioned
                before, it's not going to go ahead and damage the motherboard.
                So now I'm going to go ahead and start securing my power supply.
                It's always fun getting it, there we go.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you can see, I normally like to go ahead and start my fingers
                so it's easier to get in. And then once I put all my screws in,
                I'm going to go ahead and use my screwdriver and fasten it,
                tighten that. There you go. So let's go ahead and tighten our
                screws right here.
              </p>
              <p>
                Great, so now we've secured our power supply to the case, so
                some won't move anywhere. And just another note, you can also
                install the power supply before adding it to the motherboard
                depending on how your case is laid out.
              </p>

              <h4>Adding Graphics and Other Peripherals</h4>
              <p>
                Let's go back to our massive connectors. There are few things I
                would like to highlight. This big one right here. This is the
                one that house our motherboard. Another one that we have, it's
                more of a legacy one is for pin Molex. These connections were
                used heavily before SATA came out. Now we use these connectors
                to power majority of the SATA devices today. Most modern
                machines today will probably use SATA connectors for your hard
                drives. It may come with Molex to SATA adapters. Now, it's time
                for the fun part. First, let's go ahead and connect our power
                supply to our motherboard. That's this big pin, as we discussed
                earlier. It's going to go in right here. Plug that in like so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, we're going to go ahead and power the CPU with this pen
                right here. Pretty tight, but you should be able to get it in.
                There you go. What we just did was we have the power supply is
                powering the motherboard and the CPU. Now that we've hooked up
                to cable to our CPU and motherboard, next thing that we need to
                hook up are these cables that are sitting in our case. This is
                going to vary from case to case, but let's go through it. Some
                of these cables are used for your cases, buttons, and lights.
                For this one, I'm going to plug these in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our case cables are now secured to a motherboard. One good idea
                is sometimes your motherboard will come with some guides. This
                will help you fasten your cables to your motherboard so it's
                clean and tight on your case. I'm just going to go ahead and do
                that right here. Now that we have our cables securely fastened
                to our case, let's not forget one more thing, how graphics card
                we'll need that so we can upload a video to our monitor. We're
                going to plug this graphics card into our PCI Express lot on our
                motherboard. Just like the RAM, you are going to put a little
                bit of pressure when you insert the same. Don't feel bad by
                putting a little bit of pressure and you hear a click like this,
                which you've done it, you can tightly secure it to your case.
                This is going to vary from case to case.
              </p>
              <p>
                There you go. Your graphics card has been installed. I think
                that's it. Let's cover up our computer. First make sure you take
                your anti-static bracelet away. Get our case put that in like
                so. Just plug. That's it.
              </p>
              <p>
                There you go. We finally built our machine. Last, but not least,
                let's connect our monitor keyboard, mouse to the desktop. First,
                let's get our keyboard. We're going to do is going to connect
                this USB to the USB port on our desktop.
              </p>
              <p>
                Want to get our mouse, do the same thing, connect this to our
                USB port then finally, we're going to go ahead and connect our
                monitor. For this monitor we're going to go ahead and use a
                display port cable. Want to connect one end to our desktop like
                so. Next I'm going to plug this into my monitor.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the most interesting part. Let's see if all this works.
                I'm going to power it on, I got blue light, which is good, off
                course it's going to vary from system to system. Let's see if
                something shows up on the monitor. Computer is booting up. Let's
                see. It looks like the monitor is receiving signal. Just good
                it. There we have messages. Success, there we go. It's working
                perfect.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're having issues with your computer not starting up,
                that's okay. Check that your power supply can supply the correct
                amount of wattage or make sure your connectors are in the right
                place. Oh, what's this non-system disk or disk area replace and
                strike any key when ready. Looks like our disk doesn't have an
                operating system to boot into. No worries. That's what we'll be
                discussing in the next set of lessons. We'll learn what an
                operating system is, and what the main operating systems are and
                how to install one. Well, good job. You've got your computer up
                and running and it monitors were seeing signal so that's it.
                Let's take a moment and think about what you just did. Not only
                did you learn about each component of a computer, but you
                figured out how they work individually and then we built one
                together. It's quite an accomplishment.

              <h4>Mobile Display Types</h4>
              <p>
                In this reading, you will learn about several types of displays
                used in modern mobile devices and monitors. As an IT Support
                professional, you may need to troubleshoot various types of
                displays. This might involve repairing damaged mobile device
                screens. You may even be responsible for selecting and ordering
                mobile devices for the employees of an organization. In your IT
                job role, you should have a basic understanding of the
                technology behind modern displays, as well as their common uses,
                positive features, and negative flaws. The top two technologies
                used in mobile system displays are Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
                and Light Emitting Diodes (LED).
              </p>
              <h5>Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)</h5>
              <p>
                LCDs use liquid crystal technology. Liquid crystals have the
                properties of both a liquid and a solid. The crystals can be
                aligned in a variety of patterns and manipulated with
                electricity. How the liquid crystals are arranged and
                manipulated inside display panels affects refresh rates, image
                quality, and display performance. LCDs require backlighting,
                often provided by LEDs. Displays that need backlighting are also
                called non-emissive or passive displays. The backlighting unit
                (BLU) requires extra space, which makes LCD panels thicker and
                less flexible than other displays. Polarizers on either side of
                the liquid crystal layer control the path of the backlight to
                ensure the light is aimed toward the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                The following are common LCD display types used for mobile
                devices:
              </p>
              <h6>In-Plane Switching (IPS)</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How it works:</b> In IPS displays, the liquid crystals are aligned
                  horizontally to the screen. Electricity is passed between the
                  ends of the crystals to control their behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uses:</b> IPS technology is used in touch screen displays and
                  high-end monitors. They are often used for design,
                  photography, video/film editing, animation, movies, and other
                  media. They can also be used for games that rely on color
                  accuracy and wide viewing angles, as opposed to speed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Positives:</b> IPS displays provide vibrant colors, high quality
                  graphics, and wide viewing areas. Additionally, they offer
                  excellent color reproduction, accuracy, and contrast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Negatives:</b> IPS displays are expensive. They have low refresh
                  rates and slow response times. However, response times have
                  been improving as the IPS technology evolves. IPS displays can
                  be affected by “IPS Glow”, where the backlight is visible from
                  side viewing angles.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Twisted Nematic (TN)</h6>
              <p>
                Twisted Nematic (TN) is the earliest LCD technology that is
                still in use today. The term nematic, which means “threadlike,”
                is used to describe the appearance of the molecules inside the
                liquid.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How it works:</b> In TN displays, the liquid crystals are twisted.
                  When voltage is applied, the crystals will untwist to change
                  the angle of the light they transmit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uses:</b> TN displays are appropriate for basic business use
                  (e.g., email, document, and spreadsheet applications). They
                  are also used for games that need rapid display response
                  times.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Positives:</b> TN displays are low cost, easy to produce, have
                  excellent refresh rates, response times, and resolutions. They
                  are versatile and can be manufactured for any size and/or
                  shape.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Negatives:</b> TN displays have narrow viewing angles, low image
                  quality, color distortion, and poor color accuracy and
                  contrast.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>VA-Vertical Alignment</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How it works:</b> In VA displays, the liquid crystal molecules are
                  vertically aligned. They tilt when electricity passes through
                  them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uses:</b> VA displays are intended for general purpose. Provides
                  mid-range performance for graphic work, movies, and TV.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Positives:</b> VA displays offergreat contrast, deep black shades,
                  and fast response times. They are mid-range quality for
                  refresh rates, image quality, viewing angle, and color
                  reproduction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Negatives:</b>On VA displays, motion blur and ghosting occurs
                  with fast-motion visuals.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED)</h5>
              <p>
                OLEDs are diodes that emit light using organic (carbon-based)
                materials when electricity is passed through the diodes.
                Displays that are able to convert electricity into light are
                called emissive or active displays.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How it works:</b> The basic structure of an OLED display consists
                  of an emissive layer placed between a cathode (which injects
                  electrons) and an anode (which removes electrons). Electricity
                  enters through the cathode layer, passes into the emissive
                  layer and conductive layer to create light, then out through
                  the anode layer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uses:</b> OLED display technology can be used in foldable
                  smartphones, rollable TVs, as backlighting in LCD TVs, for
                  gaming, and inside VR headsets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Positives:</b> OLED displays deliver excellent picture quality,
                  wide viewing angles, infinite contrast, fast response rate,
                  and brilliant colors with true blacks. They are energy
                  efficient, simpler to make, and much thinner than LCDs. OLED
                  panels can be built to be flexible and even rollable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Negatives:</b>OLED displays are sensitive to light and moisture.
                  Blue LEDs degrade faster than other LED colors causing color
                  distortion over time. They are also prone to image retention
                  and burn-in.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED)</h6>
              <p>
                Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) and Super
                AMOLED are recent technologies used in smartphone displays.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How it works:</b> AMOLED displays are a type of OLED panel that
                  uses active matrix technology. Active-matrix displays have
                  active capacitors arranged in a matrix with thin film
                  transistors (TFTs). This technology enables the control of
                  each individual pixel for rapid state changes, including
                  changing brightness and color. AMOLEDs have touchscreen
                  functions integrated into the screen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uses:</b> AMOLED and Super AMOLED panels are used in high-end
                  mobile devices, flat screen monitors, curved screens, and
                  touchscreens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Positives:</b> AMOLED displays offer a high picture quality and
                  fast response time. Color and brightness are consistent across
                  the screen. Fast-moving images and motion are displayed
                  clearly without blurring or ghosting. Super AMOLED panels can
                  display a wider range of colors with enhanced contrast, which
                  makes them easy to view in a wider variety of lighting
                  conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Negatives:</b>AMOLED displays have the same problems as OLED
                  displays (listed above) plus AMOLED panels can be difficult
                  and expensive to manufacture.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Inorganic mini-LEDs (mLEDs)</h5>
              <p>
                Inorganic mini-LEDs (mLEDs) are a next-generation, emissive
                display technology.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How it works:</b> Mini-LED displays work the same way that OLED
                  displays work, but the individual LED size is much smaller at
                  approximately 50-60 micrometers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uses:</b> Mini-LED displays are used for LCD backlighting in
                  smartphones, public information displays, signage,
                  electronics, vehicle displays, and more. Mini-LEDs are also
                  the tech behind “Liquid Retina XDR” screens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Positives:</b> Mini-LED displays offer ultra high luminance,
                  superior HDR fineness, long lifetimes, thin panels, and are
                  readable in sunlight. They are also less expensive than
                  micro-LED displays.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Negatives:</b>Mini-LED displays, when used as LCD backlighting,
                  are limited by the properties of LCD technology. Mini-LED
                  displays for mobile devices are more expensive than OLED
                  displays.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Inorganic micro-LEDs (μLEDs)</h6>
              <p>
                Micro-LEDs (μLEDs) are also emissive, next-generation displays.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>How it works:</b> Micro-LED displays work the same way that OLED
                  displays work, but the individual LED size is extremely small
                  at 15 micrometers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Uses:</b> Micro-LED displays can be used in smartphones, AR/VR
                  headsets, wearables, public information displays, wall-sized
                  TVs, vehicle displays, and more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Positives:</b> Micro-LED displaysoffer superior performances
                  across virtually all common display features, such as
                  brightness, reaction speeds, power consumption, durability,
                  color gamut, stability, viewing angles, HDR, contrast, refresh
                  rates, transparency, seamless connectivity, and more.
                  Micro-LED displays are readable in sunlight and have sensor

              <h4>Operating system's components</h4>
              <p>
                A lot of us hear the term operating system and think of the
                interfaces of our desktops and phones, like the menus, buttons
                and backgrounds. Technically these are part of the operating
                system but it's a little more complex than that.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                An operating
                system is the whole package that manages our computers resources
                and lets us interact with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are <b>two main parts to an
                operating system, the <span title="">kernel</span> and the user space</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The kernel is
                the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our
                hardware and manages our system's resources.
              </p>
              <p>
                As users we don't interact with the kernel directly. Instead, <b>we
                interact with the second part of an operating system, the user
                space. The user space is basically made up of everything outside
                the kernel. These are things that we interact with directly like
                system programs, user interfaces, etc</b>. When we say
                operating system, we're talking about both the kernel and the
                user space. There are hundreds of operating systems out there,
                but we'll focus on the major ones used in IT, Windows, Mac and
                Linux.

                Windows OS is developed by Microsoft and used widely in the
                business and consumer space. Most pcs you buy come with Windows
                as the default operating system. PC means personal computer,
                which technically means a computer that one person uses. But in
                today's world, PC is more commonly referred to as a Windows
                computer. So we'll just referred to a PC as a Windows computer
                from here.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Mac OS by Apple is mainly used in the consumer space. If you buy
                an Apple computer, it'll come with Mac OS preloaded.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The last operating system will dive into as the Linux operating
                system. Linux is an open source operating system which means its
                software is free to share, modify and distribute. Linux is used
                heavily in business infrastructure and in the consumer space.
                Linux itself is actually a kernel developed by Linus Torvalds.
                Because of the way it evolved, we call the kernel the Linux
                operating system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Linux has become a huge community
                effort with developers all over the world contributing to its
                success. Because Linux is open source lots of different
                organizations package their own version of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Operating systems like Windows or Macintosh, on the other hand,
                are solely developed by the respective companies. We call these
                different Linux OSs distributions. Some common Linux
                distributions are ubuntu, debian and red hat.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another operating system that has started to gain popularity is
                chrome OS but we won't go into detail on that one. Mobile phone
                usage around the world is more prevalent than desktop computers.
                One cool thing to call out is that <b>chrome OS and android OS both
                run the Linux kernel underneath the hood</b>. So there's a chance
                you've already worked with Linux and didn't even know it.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are lots of operating systems out there and they all share
                common characteristics. If you're able to understand the basic
                building blocks of one OS, you can apply that to any operating
                system and understand how it works. In IT support It's super
                common to work with many different operating systems, desktop
                OSs, to smartphone OSs and more. Before we get there let's do a
                rundown of the basics.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The kernel does file storage and file management. You can
                compare it to a physical office file where we store data in
                paper form. A computer file is just data that we store and a
                file can be anything, a word document, a picture of song,
                literally anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                A <b>file system is how we manage these files</b>,
                just like in an office we use a system to store our files. We
                don't just put all our files in one cabinet that would be
                seriously messy. Instead we organize those files in folders or
                directories to make them easier to find.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another important function
                of the kernel is <span class="important_word">process management</span>. We have many programs that
                we want to run on our system. To run them we manage the order
                they run in, how many resources they take up, how long they run
                etcetera. Our kernel helps us do this with its process
                management capabilities. For example, you've probably used your
                computer to do several tasks at once. Maybe you writing a text
                document while listening to music or playing a video.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The
                process scheduler is part of the kernel that makes this
                multitasking possible. It switches the execution of each
                different process on the CPU faster than you can blink and it
                gives you the illusion that things are happening simultaneously.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next up is <span class="important_word">memory management</span>. <b>Our kernel optimizes memory usage
                and make sure our applications have enough memory to run</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The
                last important function that a kernel performs is input, output or <span class="important_word">IO management</span>. <b>This is how our kernel talks to external
                devices, like disks, keyboards, networks, connections, audio
                devices and more. IO management is anything that can give us
                input or that we can use for output of data</b>. If you've ever
                saved a file to disk, click the mouse button or used a
                microphone when video chatting with a friend, you've got the
                kernel's ability to manage IO to think. And that's the basic
                rundown of the main functions of the kernel file management,
                process management, memory management and IO management.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, we'll talk about the other component of an operating
                system, the <span class="important_word">user space</span>. <b>The user space is everything outside the
                kernel. These are the things that we interact with directly,
                like programs such as text editors, music players, system
                settings, user interfaces, etcetera</b>. By the end of this module,
                you'll hopefully have a solid understanding of all these
                functions of an operating system.

              <h4>Files and file system</h4>
              <p>
                Imagine if you had to store a single file in a cabinet. That
                sounds so bad. What if instead of one file you had to store
                100,000? Can you see a problem here? Well, on our computers we
                can easily store hundreds of thousands of files, if not more,
                problem-solved. Not quite. We have to be able to keep track of
                all these files. <b>The kernel handles file storage and file
                systems on our machines</b>.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/file-handling.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                In this lesson, we're going to dig a little deeper on how it
                does that. There are three main components to handling files
                handlers, the file data, metadata, and file system. Let's start
                with the file system. Well, we have a brand new hard disks that
                we want to store data on. We need to erase and configure the
                disk. This way operating system can read and write data to it.
                This is important since it's how our operating system keeps
                tracks of files. We must know what kind of file system is used.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are lots of file systems and are used for different
                purposes. Some file systems support the storage of large amounts
                of data others only support small amounts. They can operate in
                different speeds and have varying resiliency towards file
                corruption and so on. We won't get into which file system is
                best. That's for you to decide. But the <b>major OS manufacturers
                have their own unique file systems that they recommend, for
                Windows, the major file system that's used is NTFS</b>. It was
                introduced in the previous version of Windows OS, Windows NT,
                and includes many features like encryption, faster access
                speeds, security, and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Microsoft is developing another file system called ReFS</b>, but it
                isn't quite ready for consumer use just yet. For <b>Linux,
                different distributions will use different file system types. A
                standard for file systems for Linux is EX T4, which is
                compatible with older EXT file systems</b>. In general, different
                file system types don't play nicely with each other. You might
                not be able to easily move files across different file systems
                depending on the file system type.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                A good guideline to use is
                just to use the file system that your operating system
                recommends.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Another important part of file management is the storage of
                actual file data. We write data to our hard drive in the form of
                data blocks. When we say something to our hard disks, it doesn't
                always sit in one piece. It can be broken down into many pieces
                and written to different parts of the disk. Block storage
                improves faster handling of data, because the data isn't stored
                on one long piece, and it can be accessed quicker. It's also
                better for utilizing storage space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, we need to keep the metadata that contains the
                information about our file. There's a lot of information about
                our file that we want to know, who created it, when it was last
                modified, who has access to it, and so on. <b>The file metadata
                tells us everything we need to know about our file. It also
                tells us what type of file it is. A file extension is the
                appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it
                is in certain operating systems</b>. Take cool_image.jpg. JPG is a
                file extension associated with image files. You'll see different
                types of file extensions like this.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/files-metadata.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                When you're working with your operating system, your working
                knowledge of file systems and the differences between them is a
                great skill to have in your IT support specialist toolbox. It
                can be super useful when you need to do things like recovered
                data from damaged discs or explore ways to boot from two
                different kinds of operating systems, like Windows and Linux on
                the same computer.

              <h4>Process management</h4>
              <p>
                One of the most important tasks that our kernel performs is
                process management. <b>A process is a program that's executing,
                like our Internet browser or text editor. A program is an
                application that we can run</b>, like Chrome. Take note of the
                difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can have many processes of the same program running at the
                same time. Think of how many Chrome windows you can open. These
                are all different processes for the same program. When we want
                to run our programs, we have to dedicate computer resources to
                them, like RAM and CPU. We only have a finite amount of
                resources, and we want to be able to run multiple programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our kernel has to manage our resources efficiently so that all
                the programs we want to use can be run. Our kernel doesn't just
                dedicate all of our computers resources to one process. <b>Our
                system is actually constantly running multiple processes that
                are necessary for it to function. Our kernel has to worry about
                all of these processes at once. What a program wants to run, a
                process needs to be created for it. This process needs to have
                hardware resources like RAM and CPU</b>. The kernel has to schedule
                time for the CPU to execute the instructions in the process, but
                there's only one CPU and many processes.
              </p>
              <p>
                How is the CPU able to execute multiple processes at once? It
                actually doesn't. <b>CPU executes processes one-by-one through
                something known as a time slice. A time slice is a very short
                interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU
                execution</b>. It's so short that you don't even notice it. It's
                super short. The CPU executes one process in milliseconds, then
                executes another process, then another. To the human eye,
                everything looks like it runs simultaneously. That's how fast
                the CPU works.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                If your computer is running slowly, and your CPU resources are
                being maxed out, there can be many factors at play. It's
                possible that one process is taking up more time slices than it
                should. This means that the next process can't be executed.
                Another possibility is that there are too many processes that
                want CPU time and the CPU can't keep up with them. Whatever the
                case may be, even though the kernel does its best to manage
                processes for us, we might need to step in manually from
                time-to-time.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/process managing.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p>
                <b>The kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and
                manages how processes are terminated</b>. This is important since we
                need a way to collect all the previously used resources that
                active processes were taking up and reallocate them to another
                process.

              <h4>Memory Management and Virtual Memory</h4>
              <p class="important">
                Remember that when a process runs, it needs CPU time, but it
                also needs memory. When processes are run, they have to take up
                space in memory, so that the computer can read and load them
                quickly. However, compared to our hard disk drives, memory comes
                in smaller quantities.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                So to give us more memory than we
                physically have, we use something called virtual memory. Virtual
                memory is the combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts
                like memory that our processes can use.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>When we execute a process, we take the data of the program in
                <span title="">chunks</span> we call pages. We store these pages in virtual memory. If
                we want to read and execute these pages, they have to be sent to
                physical memory or RAM</b>. Why don't we just store the entire
                program in RAM so we can execute it quickly? Well you could, if
                it was small enough, but for large applications it would be
                wasteful. Have you ever worked in a word processor and then gone
                to a menu don't normally use and noticed the application slow
                down a little? It's because your computer had to load the page
                for that menu from virtual memory into RAM. <b>We don't use all the
                features of our application at once</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                So why load it up at once? It's similar to cooking a recipe from
                a cookbook. <b>You don't need to read the whole book just to make
                one recipe</b>. You only need to read the pages of the recipe you're
                currently using. <b>When we store our virtual memory on our hard
                drive, we call the allocated space <span title="">swap space</span>. When we get into
                practical applications of disk partitioning, we'll allocate
                space for swap. The kernel takes care of all of this for us of
                course. It handles the process of taking pages of data and
                <span title="">swapping</span> them between RAM and virtual memory</b>. But, the kernel
                isn't the only hard worker around.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Remember that when a process runs, it needs CPU time, but it
                also needs memory. When processes are run, they have to take up
                space in memory, so that the computer can read and load them
                quickly. However, compared to our hard disk drives, memory comes
                in smaller quantities. So to give us more memory than we
                physically have, we use something called <span class="important_word">virtual memory</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Virtual memory is the combination of hard drive space and RAM
                that acts like memory that our processes can use</b>. When we
                execute a process, we take the data of the program in chunks we
                call pages. We store these pages in virtual memory. If we want
                to read and execute these pages, they have to be sent to
                physical memory or RAM. Why don't we just store the entire
                program in RAM so we can execute it quickly? Well you could, if
                it was small enough, but for large applications it would be
                wasteful.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/virtual-memory.jpeg" alt="virtual memory" />
              <p class="important">
                When we
                store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the
                allocated space swap space. When we get into practical
                applications of disk partitioning, we'll allocate space for
                swap.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The kernel takes care of all of this for us of course. It
                handles the process of taking pages of data and swapping them
                between RAM and virtual memory.

              <h4>I/O Management</h4>
              <p>
                So far we've learned how hard our kernel works by handling
                files, managing file storage, juggling all the different
                processes running on our computer, and allocating memory.
                Another important task that our kernel handles is managing input
                and output.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                We refer to devices that perform input and output as I/O
                devices. These include our monitors, keyboards, mice, hard disk
                drives, speakers, Bluetooth headsets, webcams and network
                adapters. These I/O devices are all managed by our kernel, the
                kernel needs to be able to load up drivers that are used so that
                we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware.
                When the kernel is able to start the drivers to communicate with
                hardware, it also manages the transfer of data in and out of the
                devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>I/O doesn't just mean the transfer of data between us and our
                devices. The devices also need to be able to talk to each other.
                Our kernel handles all the inter communication between devices.
                It also figures out what the most efficient method of transfer
                is and it tries its best to make sure our data doesn't have
                errors during process</b>.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/i-o-devices-exp.jpeg" alt="" />
              <p class="important">
                When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow
                machine it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency.
                If you don't have enough RAM you can't load up as many
                processes. If you don't have enough CPU you can't execute
                programs fast enough. If you have too much input coming into the
                device or too much output going somewhere you'll also block
                other data from being sent or received. It's slow is one of the
                most common problems you'll solve in an IT support role.
              </p>
              <p>
                Knowing the potential sources of that slowness is a big help
                when you're trying to narrow down the cause of the <span title="">latency</span>.
                Troubleshooting is such an important part of any IT support
                role. Beyond desktop support, identifying the source of a
                resource bottleneck and a server or large IT system like a Web
                application can unlock performance gains and new heights of
                responsiveness for your users.

              <h4>Interacting with the OS: User Space</h4>
              <p>
                We've covered the kernel's major responsibilities. Now, let's
                discuss the final major aspect of an operating system, how
                humans interact with it. This is what we call the userspace.
                When we interact with an operating system, we want to do certain
                functions like creating files and folders, open applications,
                and deleting items, you get the idea. <b>There are two ways that we
                can interact with our OS. With a shell or graphical user
                interface</b>. There are also some shells that use graphical user
                interfaces, but we'll work with a Command Line Interface or CLI
                shell. For the most part, this just means that we'll use text
                commands.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                A <span class="important_word">Graphical User Interface</span> or GUI is a visual way to interact
                with the computer. We use our mouse to click and drag, to open
                folders, etc. We can see everything we do with it. You probably
                use a GUI every day without realizing you're using one. To watch
                this video, you probably used GUI clicking icons and navigating
                menus to open your web browser and navigate to the website.
                People usually recognize a device or product based on its GUI.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might be able to spot the difference between a computer
                running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS based on the design of the
                windows, menus, and icons, you've probably seen GUI's and other
                places too, like mobile phones and tablets, ATM machines, and
                airport kiosks. A shell is basically a program that interprets
                text commands and sends them to the OS to execute. Before we had
                fancy visual interfaces, commands like create a file had to be
                typed out. While we have GUI is today, the shell is still
                commonly used to run commands, especially by power users.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Power users are above average computer users</b>. Linux, especially,
                it's essential that you actually know commands, not just a GUI.
                This is because most of them Linux machines you interact with in
                IT support will be accessed remotely. Most of the time, you
                won't be given a GUI. There are lots of different types of
                shells. Some have different features, some handled performance
                differently. It's the same concept behind different operating
                systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                For our purposes, we'll just be using the most common shell,
                Bash or bourne. Again, shell in Linux, you might be thinking,
                but it's easier for me to navigate a GUI than it is to use
                commands to do the same thing. Why would I want to learn both? I
                can't stress this enough. It's vital for you to know how to use
                a shell in an IT support role. Some tests can only be completed
                through commands. In more advanced IT roles, you might have to
                manage thousands of machines. You don't want to have to click a
                button or drag a window on every machine when you can just run a
                command once.

              <h4>Logs</h4>
              <p>
                Imagine this scenario. You're playing your favorite video game
                and you finally get to the big boss. You spent countless hours
                finding this boss, neglecting all other responsibilities, like
                your job, school, even hygiene. That's pretty gross, but I get
                it. So you're right about to kill the big boss when suddenly
                your game console shuts off completely. You probably freak out
                for a second. But then you remember it's okay, you saved the
                game before the boss came along.
              </p>
              <p>
                So now you can turn it back on and you'll be at the same spot.
                But then your console shuts off again. This happens over and
                over. You like most people are devastated. You into a fit of
                rage, but then just before you toss your console out, you make
                one last dish effort and yell, tell me what's wrong with you.
                Suddenly you hear a faint voice telling you what you want to
                hear. But my point is that <b>our computers actually can
                talk to us and tell us what's wrong. Maybe they won't whisper
                answers to us, but they speak to us in the form of logs</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Logs or files that record system events on our computer, just
                like a system's diary. A computer will record events like when
                it was turned on, when a driver was loaded. And even when
                something isn't working in the form of error messages. In all
                operating systems, logs are kept so we can refer back to them
                when we need to find out something that happened. But logs can
                be hard to navigate because our computer will essentially record
                everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's what a log looks like. As you can see, it can be tough to
                make your way through a log. But with a little bit of <span title="">elbow
                grease</span>, we can figure out what happened on our computer and
                piece together a solution. Unfortunately, our computers, cars
                and machines don't have a little voice that tells us what's
                wrong when there's a problem. But by the end of this program,
                you'll be able to navigate and read logs so you won't even need
                it.

              <p>
                In this lesson, we're going to learn how our operating system
                starts up. As an IT support specialist, you'll probably work on
                lots of computers that won't start. It's important to know the
                steps that operating system takes, so you can help diagnose the
                issue. Booting a computer or starting a computer comes from the
                phrase to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps. Basically, it
                means to start from nothing and follow a series of steps to
                arrive at a fully operational system.
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/10.boot-process.jpeg" alt="boot process" />
              <p>
                When we start up with computer, will use the term boot. <b>For most
                operating systems, the boot process follows a general pattern,
                much like how we have different cars startup in the same way</b>.
                Put in the key, turn on the ignition, etc. Here's a <span title="">rundown of
                the boot process</span>.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  First, the computer is powered on. The
                  <b>BIOS/UEFI is a low-level software that initializes our
                  computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go</b>.

                </li>
                <li>
                  Next, depending on the bios or UEFI configuration of boot device
                  will be selected. <b>Devices that are attached to our system, like
                  hard drives, USB drives, CD drives, etc, are configured in a
                  certain boot order</b>. The devices will be checked in this order
                  and the computer will search for what's known as a bootloader.

                <li>
                  <b>The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating
                    system</b>. Once our computer finds a bootloader on a device in the listed
                    order, it will start to execute this program. This will then
                    start to load a larger and more complex program and eventually
                loads our operating system.

                <li>
                  <b>Once the bootloader loads up our

              <h4>Boot Methods</h4>
              <p>
                While the most common way to boot a computer is to simply push
                the power button and allow the normal process to run, there are
                many other boot options. This reading covers the various methods
                you can use to boot a computer.
              </p>
              <h5>Internal method</h5>
              <p class="important">
                You can create <span title="">partitions on the computer’s drive</span> so that only
                one part of the drive runs the boot process. A common reason to
                partition your drive is to have two separate operating systems
                on your computer, such as both Windows and Linux. When you have
                two operating systems on your drive, you must choose which one
                will run the boot process. Having two possible systems to boot
                into is called dual booting.
              </p>
              <p>
                While having two operating systems can be helpful for various
                reasons, it is especially helpful when one system is failing or
                unable to boot. If this happens, you can still boot the computer
                using the other system and troubleshoot from there.
              </p>
              <h5>External tools</h5>
              <p class="important">
                External tools can be used to boot the computer. You can load
                the needed resources on an external tool to boot a system before
                any problems happen. External bootable devices include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>USB drive:</b> You use a USB drive loaded with resources needed to
                  boot the computer. This drive is inserted into a USB port and
                  chosen at startup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Optical Media:</b> You use a disk loaded with booting resources.
                  This disk can be a DVD, CD, or Blu-ray disk and is loaded
                  through the computer's optical drive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Solid State Boot Drive:</b> You use a solid state drive to boot.
                  Solid state drives do not use spinning discs or moving parts.
                  This solid state drive can be installed in your computer or
                  can be a smaller device such as a flash drive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>External hot-swappable drive:</b> You boot from an external hard
                  drive that can be moved between computers without turning it
                  off.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Network boot:</b> You boot the operating system directly from a
                  local area network (LAN) without using a storage device. Your
                  computer must be connected to a LAN for this option.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Internet-based boot:</b> You boot the computer from an internet
                  source, as long as it is a secure source. Your computer must
                  be connected to the internet for this option.

              <p class="important">
                In order to boot either Windows OS or Linux OS with an external
                tool, you’ll need to enter BIOS at startup by pressing
                F2/F12/Del keys. From there you can change the boot order so
                that the first option is the external tool you want to use.

              <h4>Boot Methods Best Practices</h4>
              <p>
                <b>The most common way to boot a computer is to simply push the
                power button and allow the normal startup process to run</b>. But
                what happens if the normal startup process becomes corrupted and
                the computer will not boot? Or maybe you would like to run a
                computer on a different operating system than the one specified
                by your normal boot process. For situations like these, you have
                several options for booting your operating system. This reading
                covers the various methods you can use to boot a computer.
              </p>
              <h5>The boot process</h5>
              <p class="important">
                When your computer is powered on, the BIOS/UEFI (BIOS) runs a
                series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in
                proper working order. The BIOS is a low-level software that
                initializes a computer's hardware to make sure everything is
                good to go.
              </p>
              <p>
                A boot device is selected based on a boot order that
                is configured in the BIOS. Devices that are attached to your
                system, like hard drives, USB drives, and CD drives are checked
                in this configured boot order and the computer searches these
                devices for a small program called a “bootloader.” <b>Once your
                computer finds a bootloader on a device, it executes this
                program. The bootloader program then initiates a process that
                loads the specific operating system setup that you want to use</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can choose a computer’s boot method by telling the BIOS on
                which device to search for the bootloader. <b>If you want to run an
                OS setup that’s stored on a USB drive, you can configure the
                boot order in your computer’s BIOS to search for a bootloader on
                a USB drive first</b>.
              </p>
              <h5>Configuring boot options</h5>
              <p class="important">
                Boot order is the order in which a computer chooses which boot
                files to use to startup. The boot order determines your boot
                method. To set the boot order for a computer, you need to enter
                the BIOS and configure the boot options.
              </p>
              <p>
                To enter your computer’s BIOS on a Windows or Linux computer,
                power on the system and look for an on-screen message that says
                which function key you should press to enter setup. The function
                keys used for entering the BIOS vary between computer
                manufacturers and the version of BIOS. Some of the more common
                function key messages are "Press DEL to enter SETUP,"
                "F2=SETUP," or "Press F12 to enter SETUP." If booting macOS,
                press and hold the Option key at startup. This will open up the
                Startup Manager, which will scan your computer and identify
                bootable devices. Then you can choose the bootable device you
                want to use.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you press the specified function key during the Windows or
                Linux power up process (before the OS begins to load), you will
                open your BIOS program. A BIOS screen will look similar to this:
              </p>
              <img src="image/1/2/10.boot-process-add.png" alt="" />
              <p>
                The BIOS screen will vary depending on your computer
                manufacturer and BIOS version, but all BIOS programs will
                feature a Boot Options menu. The Boot Options menu is where you
                can set your preferred boot method.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The boot options menu lists all the devices attached to your
                system where it may find a bootloader program. These include
                devices like internal hard drives, USB drives, CD drives, as
                well as other storage options, like network storage or cloud
                storage. In the BIOS boot options menu you can set the specific
                order you want to search these devices for the bootloader that
                will load your OS setup. The BIOS will run the first bootloader
                that it finds.
              </p>
              <h5>Boot method options</h5>
              <p>
                You may find the following boot methods listed in your BIOS boot
                options:
              </p>
              <h6>External options</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>USB drive:</b> You use a USB drive loaded with resources
                  needed to boot the computer. This drive is inserted into a USB
                  port and chosen at startup.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Optical Media:</b> You use an optical media disk loaded
                  with booting resources. This disk can be a DVD, CD, or Blu-ray
                  disk and is loaded through the computer's optical drive.
                </li>
                <p class="important">
                  The USB drive and optical media methods are useful for
                  recovering a computer with a corrupted OS. They can also be
                  used to start up a computer with a different OS. For example,
                  you might boot a Windows computer in a Linux environment by
                  using a USB with Linux OS. You will need to prepare these
                  media with a bootable OS in order to use them as a boot method
                  (see resources linked below).
                </p>
                <li>
                  <b>Solid State Boot Drive:</b> You can use a solid state drive
                  to boot your computer. Solid state drives do not use spinning
                  discs or moving parts. This solid state drive can be installed
                  in the computer or can be a smaller device such as a flash
                  drive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>External hot-swappable drive:</b> You may boot from an
                  external hard drive that can be moved between computers
                  without turning it off.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Network boot:</b> You can boot an operating system directly
                  from a local area network (LAN) without using a storage
                  device. Your computer must be connected to a LAN for this
                  option. The network boot is used when the computer does not
                  have an OS installed, among other things. To boot from a
                  network, you will need to set up the Preboot Execution
                  Environment (PXE) capability on the BIOS and have the network
                  environment prepared for this type of request (see resources
                  linked below).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Internet-based boot:</b> You boot the computer from an
                  internet source, as long as it is a secure source. If you are
                  in charge of a network and your server is down for any reason,
                  you can use this boot method to remotely power on the server
                  and restart network operations. Internet-based boot can be
                  achieved in one of two ways:
                  <ol class="number-list">
                    <li>
                      <b>Remote access</b>. Remote Access Controller (IPMI or similar)
                      has to be enabled on the BIOS and the computer needs to
                      have a Remote access control device, such as IDRAC (see
                      resources linked below).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Wake on LAN (WoL)</b>. This process requires the WoL option
                      enabled on the BIOS (see resources linked below). The WoL
                      instruction should come from a device in the network or
                      use a WoL gateway, and the network card should have WoL
                      capability.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Internal options</h6>
              <p>
                <b>Disk partitions:</b> You can create partitions on your
                computer’s drive so that only one part of the drive runs the
                boot process. A common reason to partition your drive is to have
                two separate operating systems on your computer. For example,
                you could have Windows on one partition of your drive and Linux
                on the other. When you have two operating systems on your drive,
                you must choose which one will run the boot process. Having two
                possible systems to boot into is called dual booting.
              </p>
              <p>
                While having two operating systems can be helpful for various
                reasons, it is especially helpful when one system is failing or
                unable to boot. If this happens, you can still boot the computer
                using the other system and troubleshoot from there.

              <h4>Choosing an Operating System</h4>
              <p>
                In the last lesson, you learned how an operating system boots
                up. It's an important concept to understand since you'll be
                faced with troubleshooting boot up issues in IT support. Now,
                we're going to walk through the steps to select and install an
                operating system. We're going to focus on operating systems in
                the IT space. First, we'll talk about deciding which operating
                system to install in a business setting. Second, we'll dive into
                the overall process of installing an operating system.
              </p>
              <p>
                How do you decide which operating system to install? Well, you
                need to ask yourself a couple of questions. Has the decision
                already been made? The operating systems in use by an
                organization have a lot to do with the applications and systems
                that they need to run. Are you working with an organization or
                service that requires the use of a specific operating system? If
                so, you're done.
              </p>
              <p>
                That was easy. If a decision hasn't been made on what OS to use
                or if you're looking for an operating system for personal use,
                then you need to ask yourself what software will need to be run
                on this device and lots of cases the software will be designed
                to run on a specific operating system. It's also possible that
                the software is cross-platform, meaning it can run on more than
                one operating system.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another question to ask, is what hardware will be used? Modern
                operating systems do a pretty good job of supporting common
                hardware. You should keep in mind that some manufacturers allow
                their operating system to be only installed on their hardware.
                There's one more thing I should call out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember that we have different CPU architectures, 32-bit and
                64-bit. Our operating systems will also be optimized for this
                architecture. <b>Make sure that the CPU and OS are compatible</b>. If
                you have a 64-bit CPU, you should also install the 64-bit
                version of the operating system you choose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Okay, now that you've chosen an operating system that you want
                to use, let's work on getting it installed on our hardware. Many
                computers come with an operating system pre-installed. If you
                boot the computer in this condition, the operating system will
                continue from whatever point the vendor left it at. You'll need
                to do a couple of things to finish the installation, like
                choosing a computer name or host name, or configuring the
                network for the device.

                If you're going to be installing an operating system from
                scratch, you can use different installation media. Some
                operating system manufacturers sell their operating system in
                disk form or USB form. Some let you do reinstalls directly over
                the Internet. As an IT support specialist, you will install an
                operating system many times, so using one single disk won't be
                time-efficient or scalable. Scalability is an important concept
                that we'll cover later.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want to scale or accommodate multiple computers the added
                support is something you need to keep in mind. For now you're
                only working with one computer, so let's focus on that. Let's
                just use a USB drive to install your operating system. Most
                manufacturers have their own special USB drives with the
                installation image like Windows. For Linux, we can load up an OS
                onto any USB drive.

              <h4>Windows 10 and 11 Feature Matrix</h4>
              <p>
                Windows 10 and 11 are two operating systems IT Professionals
                work with. This reading describes the differences between them
                and highlights features that are important to IT. Windows 11 was
                released more recently and has higher system requirements than
                Windows 10. Professionals will still work with Windows 10 often,
                as many companies still use it.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The primary difference between the two operating systems is
                aesthetic. Windows 11’s design is more minimal, corners have
                been rounded, and colors are pastel. Another difference is in
                Windows 10, the start menu and taskbar are in the bottom left
                corner. In Windows 11, the start menu and taskbar are centered
                along the bottom.
              </p>
              <h6>Features</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Apps:</b> In Windows 10, apps can only be added from the
                  Windows Store or installed manually. In Windows 11, Android
                  apps can also be added natively.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Virtual desktop:</b> In Windows 10 it is possible to use
                  Virtual Desktops, but it is unintuitive to set up. In Windows
                  11, the support for virtual desktops is more user-friendly
                  making it easy to set up different desktops for work and
                  personal use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Teams: In Windows 10, Teams is included in the operating
                  system, but defaults to Skype for video conferencing. In
                  Windows 11, Teams is featured prominently and incorporated
                  into the taskbar and no longer defaults to Skype for video
                  conferencing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Widgets:</b> In Windows 10, there are desktop gadgets
                  similar to widgets that can be added to the start menu. In
                  Windows 11, widgets can be accessed from the taskbar directly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Touch and pen:</b> Windows 11 has added more features for
                  touch and pen use on supported devices, including vibration
                  features for pens.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Random Access Memory (RAM) Support Limitations:</b> In
                  Windows 10, the lowest RAM (Random Access Memory) requirements
                  are 1GB for 32-bit versions and 2GB for 64-bit versions. In
                  Windows 11, the base requirement is 4GB of RAM.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Services and settings</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Domain access:</b> Joining a domain, a centrally
                  administered group of computers, functions the same in Windows
                  10 and 11. A user can quickly join a domain from the “System
                  Properties” window.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Workgroup access:</b> Joining a workgroup, a group of
                  computers on the same Local Area Network (LAN) with shared
                  access and responsibilities, also functions the same in
                  Windows 10 and 11. A user can quickly join a workgroup from
                  the “System Properties” window.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Group Policy Settings (Gpedit.msc):</b> Editing Group
                  Policies (with Gpedit.msc) locally or using Active Directory
                  is largely unchanged. Note that Gpedit.msc is not available in
                  Home licenses of Windows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Remote Desktop Protocol:</b> The Remote Desktop tool, used
                  for connecting to the desktop of a different computer over a
                  network connection, is largely unchanged between Windows
                  versions. Note that to use a Remote Desktop Server, the server
                  machine needs to be running at least the Pro edition of
                  Windows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Bitlocker:</b> Bitlocker, a drive encryption tool included
                  with Windows, is largely unchanged. Note that Bitlocker is
                  only available for Pro and Enterprise licenses of Windows.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                Operating systems like Windows 10 and Windows 11 are constantly
                changing and evolving. As an IT professional, you may be
                required to maintain two or more versions of an operating system
                at the same time. IT professionals need to stay on top of
                changes and new development to ensure they can support their
                users.
              </p>

              <h4>Basics of Networking</h4>
              <p>
                When most people think of the Internet, they think of a magical
                cloud that lets you access your favorite websites, shop online,
                and you assumingly endless stream of cat pictures, but there
                isn't any magic involved. The Internet is just an
                interconnection of computers around the world, like a giant
                spider web that brings all of us together. We call the
                interconnection of computers a network. Computers in a network
                can talk to each other and send data to one another.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can create a simple network with just two computers. In
                fact, you might already have your own network at home connecting
                all of your home devices. Let's think on a bigger scale. What
                about the computers at your school or workplace? Are they in a
                network? They sure are. All of the computers there are linked
                together in a network. Can we link your home, school, and
                workplace's networks together? We absolutely can. Your workplace
                connects to a bigger network, and that network connects to an
                even bigger network and on and on. Eventually, you've got
                billions of computers that are interconnected, making up what we
                call the Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                You, like most people, probably access the Internet through a
                browser like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or
                something else. This is done through the <span class="important_word">World Wide Web</span>. But
                don't make the mistake of thinking the Internet is the World
                Wide Web.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The Internet is the physical connection of computers and wires
                around the world.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The web is the information on the Internet. We
                use it to access the Internet through a link like
                www.google.com.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>The World Wide Web isn't the only way we can access the
                Internet. Your email, chat, and file-sharing programs are also
                ways you can access the Internet</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                In the IT field, managing,
                building, and designing networks is known as networking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Networking is a super important and large field in IT. The
                Internet is composed of a massive network of satellites,
                cellular networks, and physical cables buried underneath the
                ground.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>We don't actually connect to the Internet directly. Instead,
                computers called servers connect directly to the Internet</b>.
                Servers store the websites that we use, like Wikipedia, Google,
                Reddit, and BBC. These websites serve content. The machines that
                we use, like our mobile phones, laptops, video game consoles,
                and more are called clients. <b>Clients request the content like
                pictures, websites from the servers. Clients don't connect
                directly to the Internet. Instead, they connect to a network run
                by an Internet service provider or ISP, like CenturyLink, Level
                3, Comcast, Telefonica and things like that</b>. ISPs have already
                built networks and run all the unnecessary physical cabling that
                connects millions of computers together in one network. They
                also connect to other networks and other ISPs.
              </p>
              <p>
                These other networks connect to the networks of Google, Reddit,
                universities, basically all the other networks in the world.
                Together, they form one giant network of computers called the
                Internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                But how do the clients know how to get to servers? Well, how
                would you send a letter to someone? You'd put your address on
                the letter and send it to the address of the person you're
                sending the letter to. Computers have addresses just like
                houses.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address.
                An IP address is composed of digits and numbers like 100.1.4.3.
                When we want to access a website, we're actually going to their
                IP address, like 172.217.6.46.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Devices that can connect to a network have another unique
                identifier called a MAC address. MAC addresses are generally
                permanent and hard-coded onto a device. A sample MAC address can
                be something like this. When you send or receive data through a
                network, you need to have both an IP and a MAC address.
              </p>
              <p>
                You might be wondering why we need to have two different numbers
                to identify something. That's a good question. Think again of
                the letter analogy we use before. An IP address is your house
                address, while the MAC address is the name of this recipient of
                the letter. You want to make sure your letter gets to the right
                location and to the right person.
              </p>
              <p>
                A more simplified example of the letter delivery would go like
                this. I'm in New York city and I got a letter that I want to
                send to a friend, May. May's halfway across the world in Tokyo.
                Our letter, we'll go through lots of places before it reaches
                her. I put her name and address on there and I also put my name
                and address on there too. When I drop my letter off at the post
                office, the mail person looks at it. He thinks, I don't know how
                to get to Tokyo from here, but there's a truck that's headed to
                Texas. He puts my letter in that truck at the post office in
                Texas. A mail person looks at the letter and says, I don't know
                how to get to Tokyo from here, but we have a truck going to San
                Francisco. She puts my letter in that truck. At the post office
                in San Francisco, yet another mail person looks at my letter. He
                says, there's a plane headed to Tokyo and puts the letter on
                that plane. When it finally reaches Tokyo, the postman there
                says, I know where May lives and delivers the letter to her.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obviously, there are many more nuance to mail delivery than what
                I described, but this process is similar to how information gets
                routed across the Internet. One thing to call out is that <b>data
                that's sent through a network is sent through packets</b>. There's
                little bits of data and you guessed it, ones and zeros. It
                doesn't matter if it's pictures, email, music, or text. When we
                move data through the network, we break them down into packets.
                When a packet gets to its destination, it will rearrange itself
                back in order. Think of a packet like a letter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's actually look at this process again, but this time we'll
                use IP addresses and MAC addresses. Natalie has a computer with
                IP address 113.8.81.2 and she wants to go to google.com and
                search for pictures of cats. Before she does that, her computer
                has to send a packet to ask google.com if it can access their
                website. Our packet knows google.com's IP address is
                172.217.6.46, but it doesn't know how to get there just yet. The
                packet travels from one place to another at each destination
                where it asks, hey, do you know where google.com is? Eventually
                it'll be routed to another destination that can get the packet
                closer and closer to google.com. Once it reaches a destination
                that can deliver the packet to a server@google.com, Google will
                send Natalie a packet saying she can access an unlimited number
                of cat pictures.

                Now that we understand what networks are. Let's talk about how
                they're connected. There are a lot of ways you can connect

                    physically connect to the network through a cable</b>. On the back
                    of the desktop we worked in the previous lessons, there's a
                    network ports that you plug your ethernet cable into.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Another way to connect to a network is through <b>Wi-Fi, which is
                      wireless networking</b>. Most modern computing systems have wireless
                      capabilities like mobile phones, smart televisions and laptops.
                      We connect to wireless networks through radios and antennas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The
                      last method will go over uses <b>fiber optic cables to connect to a
                        network</b>. This is the most expensive method since fiber optic
                        cables allow greater speeds than all the other methods, fiber
                        optic gets its name because the cables contain glass fibers that
                        move data through light instead of electricity. This means that
                        we send ones and zeros through a beam of light instead of an
                        electrical current through a copper wire.
                      </li>
                </ul>
              <p>
                How cool is that? But our cables have to connect to something.
                We don't just have millions of cables going in and out of
                computers to connect them together. Instead, computers connect
                to a few different devices that help organize our network
                together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first device that your computer connects to is a router. A
                router connects lots of different devices together and helps
                <span title="">route</span> network traffic, let's say we have four computers, A, B, C
                and D connected together through a router in the same network.
                You want to send a file from computer A to computer B. A packets
                go through the router and the router utilizes network protocols
                to help determine where to send the packet. So now our packet
                gets routed from computer A to computer B, sweet.
              </p>
              <p>
                What if we wanted to send a packet to a computer not in our
                network? What if we wanted to send a packet to our friend
                Alejandro's computer. Alejandro is on a different network
                altogether. Fortunately, our router knows how to handle that to
                the packet will get routed outside our network to our ISPS
                network using networking protocols, it's able to figure out
                where Alejandro's computer is.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this process, our packet is traveling across many
                different routers, switches and hubs, switches and hubs are also
                devices that help our data travel. Think of switches like mail
                rooms in a building, routers get our letters to the building,
                but once we're inside we use the mail room to figure out where
                to send a letter. Hubs are like company memos, they don't know
                who to send the memo to, so they send it to everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working with network devices is important to understand because
                it's likely that one day you'll have users reporting problems
                accessing the Internet, you'll want to investigate your way up
                the network stack, a technology stack. In this case a network
                stack is just a set of hardware or software that provides the
                infrastructure for a computer.
              </p>
              <p>
                So the network stack is all the components that makes up
                computer networking. You might need to investigate the network
                stack in your job. You'd start with making sure the end user
                computers are working properly. Then you turn your attention to
                other possible points of failure, like the cabling, switches and
                routers that work together to access the Internet.

              <p>
                There are lots and lots of network protocols used, and they're
                all necessary to help us get our packets in the right place.
                Think of <b>network protocols like a set of rules for how we
                transfer data in a network</b>. Imagine if you sent a letter to your
                friend Sasha, who lives in California, but your post office
                sends it out to another Sasha who lives out in New York. That
                would hopefully never happen since the post office has rules
                that they follow to make sure your letter is sent to the correct
                address.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Our networking protocols do the same thing. There are rules that
                make sure our packets are routed efficiently, aren't corrupted,
                are secure, go to the right machine, and are named
                appropriately.

                The <span>Transmission Control Protoco</span>l and the Internet Protocol, or

              <h4>The Web</h4>
              <p class="important">
                All websites can be
                accessed through the web. Websites are basically text documents
                that we format with HTML or HyperText Markup Language. It's a
                coding language used by web browsers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Web pages are generally made up of very basic components. They
                contain multimedia content like text, images, audio and video.
                When you want to navigate to a website, you would type in URL
                like, www.reddit.com. A <b>URL which stands for Uniform Resource
                Locator is just a web address similar to a home address</b>.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Notice the <b>www in the URL, it stands for World Wide Web</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The second portion, <b>reddit.com is a domain
                  name</b>. Anyone can register a domain name, it's just our website
                  name. Once a name is taken it will be registered to ICANN, the
                  Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. <b>Once a
                  domain name is registered with, ICANN, no one else can take
                  that name unless it becomes available again</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The last part of the URL, in this case is '.com'. But you can
                  also use different domain endings like reddit.net or
                  reddit.org. The different domain name endings are standards
                  for what type of website it might be. So a domain that ends in
                  .edu is mainly used for educational institutions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Remember how computers use IP addresses to find another
                computer. Well, you can do the same if you wanted to find a
                computer on the internet. Let's go ahead and type 172.217.6.46
                into a web browser and hit enter. Wait a minute, what happened?
                How come we're at Google's homepage? It turns out the <b>IP address
                172.217.6.46 maps to Google's homepage through a critical web
                protocol Domain Name System or DNS</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                DNS acts like our internet directory. And let's just use human
                readable way words to map to an IP address. The computer doesn't
                know what Google.com is. It only knows how to get to an IP
                address with DNS. It's able to map google's IP address with
                Google.com.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every time you go on a website, your computer is performing a
                DNS look up to find the IP address of the website name you typed
                in. This trick can be a good first step in diagnosing certain
                kinds of DNS issues. So <b>if you're able to access a website by
                its IP address but not its human readable domain name, then
                there's a good bet that there's probably a problem somewhere in
                the DNS configuration your network is using</b>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Understanding IP addresses can come in handy in all sorts of
                other situations you might encounter as an IT support
                specialist. The source of internet requests are usually
                identified by IP addresses in server logs. Many pieces of IT
                infrastructure need to have some kind of IP address
                configuration applied to them in order to work. DNS is a huge
                system and we'll be discussing more about it later. Now that you
                understand the basics of how the internet works.

              <h4>History of the Internet</h4>
              <p>
                Let's go back in time to the 1950s where it all started.
                Remember, back then computers were huge and bulky. If you're a
                programmer, you needed to directly interact with these massive
                computers that would get real old real fast, especially if you
                had several people who wanted to use the only computing resource
                available. The late 1960s, the US government spun up a project
                called DARPA. It went on to create the earliest version of the
                Internet that we've seen today with the ARPANET.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually, computer programmers were able to share a single
                computing resource by being able to remotely access the
                computer. But there were still a big problem. Networks couldn't
                talk to each other. It wasn't until the 1970s that we had a
                critical breakthrough in computer networking that fix this
                problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was thanks to computer scientists, Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn
                who created the method we call the Transmission Control Protocol
                and the Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP. First, only a handful of
                computers in universities, governments and businesses adopt
                TCP/IP, then hundreds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then in the span of 50 years, billions of computers. TCP/IP is
                the protocol that we use on the Internet today. Finally, people
                around the world could send data to one another. But there were
                still a problem. The information they sent was just text, it
                wasn't centralized and it was pretty bland.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then in the 1990s, a computer scientist by the name of Tim
                Berners-Lee invented the worldwide web. It utilized different
                protocols for displaying information in webpages and became the
                predominant way of communication and accessing the Internet.
                Anyone who had an Internet connection at that time was able to
                access the information source of the World Wide Web.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's been 30 years since the creation of the World Wide Web.
                We've gone from sending simple email messages in the viewing
                basic web pages to having video chats and instant news updates,
                order food, buy books, and even cars in a matter of seconds,
                taking the online course like this wasn't even possible until
                recently. The creation of the Internet that we know today was
                the culmination of knowledge and engineering from many brilliant
                scientists and organizations.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Limitations of the Internet</h4>
              <p>
                We've mentioned IP addresses a lot in this course, but we
                haven't actually gone into detail about them. There are actually
                different versions of IP addresses.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                The current protocol, Internet protocol version four, or IPV4,
                is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four
                groups. IPV4 addresses can be something like 73.55.242.3. Even
                though it might seem like a lot of possible IPV4 addresses,
                there are less than 4.3 billion IPV4 addresses. There are way
                more than 4.3 billion websites out on the web today. Some IPV4
                addresses are even reserved for special purposes. The number of
                usable IP addresses is even less.
              </p>
              <p>
                A device that wants to connect to the Internet needs to have an
                IP address. But devices around the world have already exceeded
                those numbers. Where have we been getting IP addresses? IP
                addresses have been able to keep up with the amount of devices
                in the world thanks to <b>IPV6 or Internet Protocol version 6
                addresses, IPV6 addresses consists of 128 bits, four times the
                amount that IPV4 uses</b>, which means way more devices can have IP
                addresses.
              </p>
              <p>
                The adoption of IPV6 addresses has been slow but steady.
                Eventually, you'll start seeing more and more IPV6 addresses in
                the wild. An example of IPV6 address can be something like this:
              </p>
              <img
                src="image/1/4/ipv6-address.jpeg"
                alt="ipv6 address example"
              />
              <p>
                Quite a bit of a difference, don't you think? Here's an analogy
                for how big this difference is between IPV4 and IPV6. With IPV6,
                there are two to the 128th power possible IP addresses. Two to
                the 128th power is an insanely huge number, so huge that
                scientists had trouble describing with words just how big this
                number is. Just know that we won't be running out of IPV6
                addresses anytime soon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another mitigation tool that we've been able to use is <b>NAT or
                Network Address Translation. This lets organizations use one
                public IP address and many private IP addresses within the
                network</b>. Think of that like a receptionist that a company. You
                what number to dial to get to the company. Once you reach the
                receptionist, he can transfer your call to one of the private
                numbers inside the company. Now, instead of companies using
                hundreds of public IP addresses, they can just use one IP
                address.

              <p>
                Remember the routers we talked about earlier? One task you might
                need to perform when you're an IT support specialist is to
                configure NAT on a router to facilitate communication between
                your company's network and the outside world.

                <h4>Internet of things</h4>
                <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot">What is the Internet of Things? WIRED explains</a>
                <p>
                  You may have heard of the phrase Internet of Things or IoT. This concept is pretty new, but already has a major impact on the future of computing. The concept is fairly simple. Basically, more and more devices are being connected to the Internet in a smarter fashion. Did you know that there are now smart thermostats. Instead of manually programming them when you'll be out of the house, they'll just know when you leave and turn off the air conditioning for you. Many companies out there are making smarter household devices. There are fridges that can keep track of what foods you have in there, toasters that can be controlled by your smartphone, lights that can change depending on your mood and cars that drive you instead of you driving them. The world is moving towards connecting manual devices to the internet and making them smarter. These decisions have many societal implications though, especially when it comes to cybersecurity, or personal privacy. But there's also a huge potential for IoT to completely transform the world in ways we have yet to see. In the future, people may be shocked to learn that we had to do manual things like make your own coffee, or drive to the grocery store. While you may not experience working with an Internet of Things device, you should be aware that it will become a large part of the future of computing.

              <h4>How software is built: Coding, scripting, and programming</h4>
              <p>
                Coding, scripting, and programming are all terms that might seem a little <span title="">blurry</span>. They generally refer to the same thing, but they each have small distinctions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Coding is basically translating one language to another</b>. This can be coding from English to Spanish, English to Morse code, or even English to a computer language. When someone builds an application, we refer to it as coding in application.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Scripting is coding in a scripting language</b>. We'll talk about scripting languages in a later lesson, but scripts are mainly used to perform a single or limited-range task. There are languages we can use to build these.
                Programming is coding in a programming language. Programming languages are special languages that software developers use to write instructions for computers to execute. Larger applications like your web browser, text editors, and music players, are all usually written in programming languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we use the term software, it generally refers to something that was programmed. We use these terms interchangeably, so don't sweat the details. Now, onwards and upwards. What is software made of and who builds it? It's a great question. Anyone who knows a programming or scripting language can use it to write code. There's a huge demand for this skill set and it's becoming easier for someone to learn to code. If you're going to be working in IT, it's important that you understand how software works and how it gets installed on your systems. You might encounter software errors or just good old-fashioned failures, and you need to understand how to deal with them.

                  <b>PowerShell (.ps1)</b> - Windows PowerShell is among the most common command line scripting tools used in Windows environments. PowerShell is built on the .NET platform and employs many of the same elements that programming languages do. PowerShell scripts are used for building, testing, and deploying solutions, in addition to automating system management.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Batch scripts (.bat)</b> - Batch scripts, also called batch files, have been around since the early days of MS DOS and OS/2. Batch files can execute simple tasks, like calling a set of programs to run when a computer boots up. This type of script could be useful in setting up employees’ workspaces when they power on their computers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Visual Basic Script (.vbs)</b> - Visual Basic Script is an older scripting language. It has reached its end of life for Microsoft support and has been replaced by PowerShell scripts. However, as an IT professional, you may encounter .vbs scripts on some legacy systems.
                </li>
              </ul>

                Security risks of using scripts
              </h5>
              <p>
                IT Support professionals need to be very careful when using scripts, especially with prewritten scripts copied or downloaded from the internet. Some of the security risks of using scripts could include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Unintentionally introducing malware:</b> As an IT Support professional  that is new to scripting, you may try to search the internet for assistance in writing scripts. In your search, you might find a script online for a task that you want to automate. It’s tempting to save time and effort by downloading the script and deploying it in your network environment. However, this is dangerous because scripts authored by an unverified source could potentially contain malware. Malicious scripts could have the power to delete files, corrupt data and software, steal confidential information, disable systems, and even bring down an entire network. Malicious scripts can create security weaknesses for the purpose of creating entry points for cybercriminals to penetrate networks. Scripts could also introduce ransomware attacks, which often works by encrypting file systems and then selling the decryption keys for ransom.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Inadvertently changing system settings:</b> Scripts are powerful tools for changing system settings. Using the wrong script can cause the user to inadvertently configure harmful settings. For example, one minor typo in a shell script that sets file permission security in Linux could make confidential files accessible to the world.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Browser or system crashes due to <span title="">mishandling of resources</span>:</b> Mishandling resources can lead to program crashes in the browser or cause the entire computer to crash. For example, directing too much memory to the browser can overload the computer system.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Types of Software</h4>
              <p>
                Software that's written is also protected by copyright. Software developers can choose what they do with their software. For commercial software, it's common to let someone else use their software if they pay for a license. For non-commercial software, a popular option is making it open source. This means that developers will let other developers share, modify, and distribute their software for free.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some amazing software efforts have been developed and advanced because of open source. One major example is the Linux kernel, which is used in the Android OS, and in enterprise and personal computers. Hundreds of millions of devices are running Linux at this very second. LibreOffice, GIMP, and Firefox are other examples of open-source software. Open-source projects are usually contributed by developers who work on the project for free in their free time. These massive software development efforts were essentially built by a community of volunteers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In an IT environment, you'll have to pay special attention to the types of software you use. Some may require you to pay multiple licenses to use it, others might be free and open source. It's important to check the license agreement of any software before you install it. We've talked about some of the basics of software, but now let's shift to the two types of software you'll encounter categorized by function.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Application software is any software created to fulfill a specific need, like a text editor, web browser, or graphic editor. System software is software used to keep our core system running, like operating system tools and utilities.
              </p>
                <p class="important">
                  There's also a type of system software that we haven't defined yet called <span class="important_word"></span>firmware. Firmware is software that's permanently stored on a computer component. Can you think of a firmware that we've talked about already? If you thought of the BIOS, you're right. The BIOS helps start up the hardware on your computer, and also helps load up your operating system, so it's important that it's in a permanent location.
                </p>
                <p>
                I should also call out software versions. These are important because they tell us what features were added to a specific software iteration. You'll encounter lots of software versions while you work with software. Developers might sometimes use a different standard when distinguishing a version, but in general, the majority of versions follow a sequential numbering trend. You might see something like this, 1.2.5 or 1.3.4.  You'll have to work with all kinds of software. Fortunately, it basically all works the same way. Once you learn how one piece of software works, you'll understand how others might function.
                </p>

              <h4>Revisiting Abstraction</h4>
              <p>
                Earlier in this course, we talked about how programs are instructions that are given to a CPU. We can send binary code or bits to our CPU, then they'll use an instruction set to run those commands. But these CPUS might be from different manufacturers and may have different instructions. There might even be all kinds of different hardware components like video cards and hard drives that also have their own special interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>So how do we write a program that the hardware can understand? Well, one way would be to write a program for each possible combination of CPU and hardware using the native languages and interfaces of these components, but there are potentially millions of possible configurations of hardware. So how do we get anything to work with all this complex and diverse hardware? Well, <b>thanks to the efforts of computer scientists and the principle of abstraction, we can now use programming languages to write instructions that can be run on any hardware</b>.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Recipe for <span title="">Computing</span></h4>
              <p>
                Remember that in the 1950s, computer scientists used punch cards to store programs. These punch cards represented bits that the CPU would read and then perform a series of instructions based on what the program was. The binary code could have looked like this, and the instructions will be translated to this, grab some input data from this location in memory. Using the input data, do some math, then put some output data into this location in memory. But storing programs on punch cards was a long and tedious task. The programs had to be kept on stacks and stacks of punch cards.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Computer scientists needed a better way to send instructions to a machine, but how? Eventually a language was invented called assembly language, that allowed computer scientists to use human readable instructions assembled into code that the machines could understand. Instead of generating binary code, computer scientists could program using machine instructions like this. Take integer from register 1, take integer from register 2, add integer from register 1 and register 2 and output to register 4.
              </p>
              <p>
                This example makes it look like a human could read it, but don't be fooled. Let's take an example of saying something simple like, hello world in assembly language. It looks pretty robotic, don't get me wrong that's still an improvement over its binary code cousin. But assembly language was still a thin veil from machine code. It's still didn't let computer programmers use real human words to build a program, and a program that was written for a specific CPU could only be run on that CPU or family of CPUs.
              </p>
               <p class="important">
                 A program was needed that could run on many types of CPUs, enter compiled programming languages. A compiled programming language uses human readable instructions and sends them through a compiler. The compiler takes the human instructions and compiles them into machine instructions.
                </p>
               <p>
                 Admiral Grace Hopper invented this to help make programming easier. <b>Compilers are a key component to programming and helped pave the road that led us to today's modern computing</b>. Thanks to compilers, we can now use something like this, and it would be the same thing as this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Computer scientists have developed hundreds of programming languages in the past couple of decades to try and abstract the different CPU instructions into simpler commands. Along the way, another type of language emerged that was interpreted rather than compiled, <b>interpreted languages aren't compiled ahead-of-time. A file that has code written in one of these languages is usually called a script. The script is run by an interpreter which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them</b>. You'll learn how to write code using a scripting language later in this program as an IT support specialist, scripting can help you by <span title="">harnessing the power of a computer</span> to perform tasks on your behalf, allowing you to solve a problem once and then move on to the next thing. Programming languages are used to create programs that can be run to perform a task or many tasks.

              Interacting with software

              <h4>Managing Software</h4>
              <p class="important">
                Program, software, and applications are terms that are synonymous with each other. For now, we'll go ahead and use the term software to refer to any of these. There are certain types of software that perform specific functions like drivers, which allow us to interact with our hardware. There are applications that we use for our day-to-day job functions. And there are utilities that we use like a calculator, settings, and other tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the seemingly endless options for software, how do we know which ones to use? How do we deal with them in a workplace setting and in our personal lives? Software is always changing. Developers are releasing updates. Software companies change, features are added, and so on. This constant change is completely out of our control and it can cause a lot of headaches in the IT world.
              </p>
               <p>
                 Let's say the company that builds your payroll system pushes out a software update that causes settings to change, or even worse, completely breaks the compatibility with your own company. It can happen. <b>You should always test new software before letting your company use it</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Another thing to worry about is old software.
                 <b>When you run old software on your machine, you risk being exposed to cyber security attacks that take advantage of software bugs</b>. A software bug is an error in software that causes unexpected results. For now, know that software updates usually contain critical security updates and new features and have better compatibility with your system. A good guideline is to update your software constantly.

               <p>
                 Another problem that <span title="">plagues</span> the IT world when it comes to software is software management. If you're setting up a computer for someone, you want to make sure that they'll have all the necessary tools they need to hit the ground running. That means you'll need to install all the software required for their job. That may also mean that sometimes you want to remove software that isn't required for the job. We may not realize if a piece of software we installed is malicious software, which causes harm to your computer. It's always a good idea to check if software comes from a reputable source before you install it. A common industry practice is to not allow users to install software without administrator approval. This prevents users from installing unwanted software because they're actually blocked with an error message that says they need an administrator to enter their login credentials. Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's cover the basics of software management, which include installing, updating, and removing software.

              <h4>Troubleshooting Pitfall to avoid</h4>
              <p>
                There are some common pitfalls that you should try to avoid in order to be at the top of your troubleshooting game. As an IT support specialist, you'll sometimes encounter the same issue over and over again.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Going into autopilot</b>. Makes sure you don't default to autopilot mode. Moving through issues out of habit without careful thought more often than not, they're small variables that change the problem you're seeing entirely. Ask questions and gather data so you can fully understand an issue. This takes less time than having to redo some sloppy work you did in autopilot mode.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Not finding the root cause</b>. It's very easy to get distracted by small problems that pop up but it's super important to remember there's probably a very big problem causing all these small problems. Spend a little extra time investigating the issue instead of trying to fix all the small holes. If you're trying to do a quick fix, it's tempting to wipe the system and start from scratch. This approach is like using a hammer when a surgical scalpel might be more appropriate tool. Let's say user isn't able to access a particular website, re-inventing the system isn't a great solve. It doesn't get to the root cause and it doesn't help further your knowledge investigating the problem but testing out possible issues and solutions incrementally and identifying the root cause can end up saving a lot of time and effort in the end and it feels really empowering as an IT support specialist.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Ticketing Systems and Documenting Your Work</h4>
              <p>
                Have you ever worked hard on something that had a lot of steps and took a long time only to have to do it again three months later and completely forgotten everything you did? Well that happens all the time in the IT world. That's why it's important to document the work you do. Documentation might seem like a time suck but it's a total timesaver. The first it's your <b>ticketing or bug system, tickets are common way of documenting an issue</b>.
              </p>
              <p class="important">
                Bugs are issues with the system that weren't caused by an external source.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine if every every time something broke you received an email, that be hard to keep track of and not scalable at all. <b>The IT industry utilizes systems just to keep track of this for you. Some examples are Bugzilla, JIRA and Redmine. These are all in one solutions that help you track user issues, communicate with your users and provide updates</b>. A great way to use the system for documentation is to update the ticket with what the issue is. The steps and procedures you're trying to resolve and the solution you arrived at. This is important for two reasons:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The first is that it keeps the user in the loop.</li>
                <li>The second is that it helps you audit your steps in case you need to go back and see what you did.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                 You can also write down procedures and policies to create a <span title="">documentation trail</span>. You have a lot of options of where you want to write and store your documentation. You can keep your policies and procedures in a document, web page through online file storage or lots of other mediums. Just <b>make sure it's accessible to everyone else in your company. If you have a monthly reoccurring tasks like updating old software machines, make sure to write down all the steps and then refer back to them when it's needed</b>. Documentation isn't a set it and forget it situation. Systems and processes are constantly changing, and so should your documentation. It's important to update documentation so that you aren't reading something that's old. One last thing I want to call out about writing documentation is that you don't need to get creative with your writing. You aren't writing a short story, you're writing a technical document. You want to be as concise as possible so that when someone reads your document, they can easily figure out what they need to do.
