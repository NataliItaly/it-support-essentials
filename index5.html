              <h4>The CIA Triad</h4>

              Throughout this course there will be one key acronym to keep in
              mind, the CIA. No I'm not talking about the US Central
              Intelligence agency although they do have a lot to do with
              national security. When I say CIA, I'm talking about
              confidentiality, integrity and availability. These three key
              principles are the foundation for what's widely referred to as the
              CIA triad. A guiding model for designing information security
              policies. These three principles will help you develop security
              policies in the workplace and for your own personal environments.
              Riproduci il video a partire da ::34 e segui la trascrizione0:34
              Let's start with confidentiality, confidentiality means keeping
              things hidden, in IT it means keeping the data that you have
              hidden safely from unwanted eyes. One particular method of
              confidentiality that you probably use every day it's password
              protection, only you maybe your partner should know the password
              to gain access to your bank account online. For confidentiality to
              work you need to limit access to your data only those who
              absolutely need to know how to gain access should. The I in CIA
              stands for integrity integrity means keeping our data accurate and
              untampered with the data that we send or receive should remain the
              same throughout its entire journey. Imagine if you downloaded a
              file off the Internet and the website you're downloading it from
              says the file is three megs. Then when you download it it turns
              out to be about 30 megs that's a red flag, something happened
              during the download something potentially unsafe. An unwanted file
              may now be living on your hard drive. Last, but not least let's
              look at the A in CIA which stands for availability, availability
              means that the information we have is readily accessible to those
              people that should have it. This could be many things like being
              prepared if your data is lost or if your system is down. Security
              attacks are designed to steal all kinds of things from you. Time,
              material things, your dignity. Some steal the time that you'll
              need to spend to get services back up and running. Some security
              attacks will hold your system hostage until you pay a ransom for
              it. Sounds scary and it is, but that's why you're here to learn
              how to stop these types of attacks from happening. Going through
              this course, you'll see how every aspect of security revolves
              around these three key principles, confidentiality, integrity and
              availability.

              <h4>Essential Security Terms</h4>

              Before we dive into things like bringing down digital thieves,
              let's get some of the terminology either way. We'll be using these
              terms throughout the entire course so you should know them inside
              and out before we get started. The first one is risk, the
              possibility of suffering a loss and the event of an attack on the
              system. Let's say that you buy a new phone. One security measure
              you can take to protect your device is to set up a screen lock
              using a password or pattern that you add to prevent others from
              accessing your info. A screen lock is a security feature that
              helps prevent unwanted access by creating an action you have to do
              to gain entry. If you choose not to add a screen lock to your
              phone, the risks that you take is that someone could easily gain
              access to your phone and steal your data. Even adding something as
              simple as a passcode or a screen lock can help you protect your
              personal or company data from getting into the wrong hands. Next
              up is the term vulnerability, a flaw in the system that could be
              exploited to compromise the system. Vulnerabilities can be holes
              that you may or may not be aware of. Maybe you go away for a long
              vacation and lock every door and window in your house before you
              leave but you forget to lock the bathroom window. That bathroom
              window is now a vulnerability that burglars can use to break into
              your house. Another example is when you're writing a web app and
              enable a debug account for testing during development, but forget
              to disable it before launching the app. You now have a
              vulnerability in your app then an attacker can potentially
              discover. There's a special type of vulnerability called a
              zero-day vulnerability, or zero-day for short, which is a
              vulnerability that is not known to the software developer or
              vendor but is known to an attacker. The name refers to the amount
              of time the software vendor has had to react to and to fix the
              vulnerability zero days. Another key term is exploit. Software
              that is used to take advantage of a security bug or vulnerability.
              Attackers will write up exploits for vulnerabilities they find in
              software to cause harm to the system. Let's say an attacker
              discovers a zero-day vulnerability, decides to take advantage of
              the previously unknown bug and writes a zero-day exploit code.
              That code will specifically target and take advantage of this
              unknown bug to gain access and cause damage to systems, not cool.
              The next term to know is threat. The possibility of danger that
              could exploit a vulnerability. Threats are just possible attackers
              sort of like burglars. Not all burglars will attempt to break into
              your home to steal your most prized possessions, but they could
              and so they're considered threats. Next up, hacker. A hacker in
              the security world is someone who attempts to break into or
              exploit a system. Most of us associate hackers with malicious
              figures, but there are actually two common types of hackers. You
              have black hat hackers who tried to get into systems to do
              something malicious. There are also white hat hackers who attempt
              to find weaknesses in the system, but also alert the owners of
              those systems so that they can fix it before someone else does
              something malicious. While there are other types of hackers, these
              are the two main ones and the most important for us to understand
              right now. The last term to know is attack, which is an actual
              attempt at causing harm to a system. It's super important to be
              aware of possible threats and vulnerabilities to your system so
              that you can better prepare for them. The sad reality is that
              there will always be a tax on your system. But before you start
              searching for an underground bunker to spend the rest of your days
              in, remember that there are ways that you can detect and mitigate
              attacks and we're here to help you learn how to do just that. In
              this module, we'll be talking about some of the common attacks
              you'll encounter at home and in the workplace.
              <img src="image/5/malware.jpeg" alt="" />
              Throughout the course, you'll learn how to harden your systems
              against these attacks. Turns out there are hundreds of ways that
              your system can be attacked, but there are also hundreds of ways
              that you can prevent them. We won't talk about all of them, but we
              will cover the major ones. Abandon the bunker idea and prepare to
              dive in because things were about to get real, real secure.

              <h4>Malicious Software</h4>

              Malware is a type of malicious software that can be used to obtain
              your sensitive information or delete or modify files. Basically,
              it can be used for any and all unwanted purposes. The most common
              types of malware you'll see are viruses, worms, adware, spyware,
              trojans, rootkits, backdoors, botnets. Oh my. I know it's a long
              list, but we'll go into detail about each of these and even learn
              about some real-life cases. But for now, let's talk about the most
              common forms of malware. Viruses are the best known type of
              malware. They work the same way that viruses in your body work.
              When you get sick, a virus attaches itself to a healthy cell in
              your body, then replicates itself and spreads to other healthy
              cells in your body until bam, you're sneezing and wheezing and
              you're a mess. In a computer virus, the virus attaches itself to
              some executable code like a program. When the program is running,
              it touches many files, each of which is now susceptible to being
              infected with the virus. The virus replicates itself on these
              files, does the malicious work it's intended to do and repeats
              this over and over until it spreads as far as it can. It's scary.
              Well, hold on tight. We're just getting started. Worms are similar
              to viruses, except that instead of having to attach themselves
              onto something to spread, worms can live on their own and spread
              through channels like the network. One case of a famous computer
              worm was the ILoveYou or Love Bug, which spread to millions of
              Windows machines. The worm was spread via email. Someone would
              email a message with the subject line of I love you and an
              attachment that was actually the worm disguised as a love letter
              text file. The text file was actually an executable file that when
              opened, would execute many attacks like copying itself to several
              files and folders, launching other malicious software, replacing
              files, and then hiding itself after it was done. The worms spread
              by stealing email addresses that were in the victim's computer and
              chat clients. It then proceeded to send that email out to everyone
              in the address book. The Love Bug spread across the world and
              caused billions of dollars in damage. Not so lovely. This was just
              one of the many reasons why you should never open email
              attachments that you do not recognize. Adware is one of the most
              visible forms of malware that you'll encounter. Most of us see it
              every day. Adware is just software that displays advertisements
              and collects data. Sometimes we legitimately download adware. That
              happens when you agree to the terms of service that allows you to
              use free software in exchange for showing you advertisements.
              Other times, it may get installed without your consent and may do
              other malicious things than just display advertisements. In Greek
              mythology, there's a famous tale of the evasion of the City of
              Troy. The Greeks who had been trying to gain access into the
              walled city, finally decided to hide themselves in a giant wooden
              statue of a horse under the guise of a gift. The Trojans allowed
              the gift inside then in the dead of night, the Greeks broke out of
              the statue and attacked the city. In computer security, we have
              malware that functions like a Trojan Horse, and it's named after
              this exact thing. A Trojan is malware that disguises itself as one
              thing, but does something else. Just like how the historical
              Trojan Horse was accepted into the city by the citizens of Troy, a
              computer Trojan has to be accepted by the user, meaning the
              program has to be executed by the user. No one would willingly
              install malware on their machine. That's why Trojans are meant to
              entice you to install them by disguising themselves as other
              software. Spyware is a type of malware that's meant to spy on you,
              which could mean monitoring your computer screens, key presses,
              webcams, and then reporting or streaming all of this information
              to another party. It's not good. A key logger is a common type of
              spyware that's used to record every keystroke you make. It can
              capture all of the messages you type, your confidential
              information, your passwords, and even more. Ransomware is a type
              of attack that holds your data or system hostage until you pay
              some ransom. Our case of ransomware was the WannaCry ransomware
              attack in May, of 2017. The malware took advantage of a
              vulnerability in older Windows systems, infecting hundreds of
              thousands of machines across the world. Most notably, the attacks
              shutdown the systems for the National Health Services in England,
              causing a health-related crisis. The WannaCry ransomware attack
              devastated systems around the world. These types of attacks are
              becoming more common and we need to be ready to fight them. Let's
              soldier on.

              <h4>Antimalware Protection, Malware Removal</h4>
              <p>
                Malware can disrupt, damage, or even destroy a computer. IT
                teams are often responsible for evaluating and repairing
                computers that are not running well. If a computer is performing
                poorly or acting strangely, it might be infected with malware.
                IT professionals need to know how to isolate, remove, and repair
                infected devices. This reading covers the steps to take to
                detect and remove malware.
              </p>
              <h5>Gather and verify</h5>
              <p>
                If you suspect that the computer is infected, you should gather
                information from the user. It is helpful to note when the
                symptoms started and if the user has downloaded any unusual
                files. If the computer has one or more of the following symptoms
                it may be infected with malware:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Running slower than normal</li>

                <li>Restarts on its own multiple times</li>

                <li>Uses all or a higher than normal amount of memory</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After you’ve gathered information, verify that the issues are
                still occurring by monitoring the computer for a period of time.
                One way to monitor and verify is to review the activity on the
                computer’s resource manager where you can see open processes
                running on a system.
              </p>
              <p>
                When looking at the resource manager, you might see a program
                with a name you do not recognize, a program that is using a lot
                of memory, or both. If you see a suspicious program, you should
                investigate this application by asking the user if it is
                familiar to them.
              </p>
              <h5>Quarantine malware</h5>
              <p>
                Some malware communicates with bad actors or sends out sensitive
                information. Other malware is designed to take part in a
                distributed botnet. A botnet is a number of Internet-connected
                devices, each of which runs one or more bots. Because of
                malware’s potential ability to communicate with other bad
                actors, you should quarantine the infected device.
              </p>
              <p>
                To quarantine, or separate, the infected device from the rest of
                the network, you should disconnect from the internet by turning
                off WiFi and unplugging the ethernet cable. Once the computer is
                disconnected, the malware can no longer spread to other
                computers on the network.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should also disable any automatic system backup. Some
                malware can reinfect a computer by using automatic backup,
                because you can restore the system with files infected by the
                malware.
              </p>
              <h5>Remove malware</h5>
              <p>
                Once you have confirmed and isolated the malware on a device,
                you should attempt to remove the malware from the device. First,
                run an offline malware scan. This scan helps find and remove the
                malware while the computer is still disconnected from the local
                network and internet.
              </p>
              <p>
                All anti-virus/anti-malware programs rely on threat definition
                files to identify a virus or malware. These files are often
                updated automatically, but in the case of an infected computer
                they may be incomplete or unable to update. In this case, you
                may need to briefly connect to the internet to confirm that your
                malware program is fully updated.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scan should successfully identify, quarantine, and remove
                the malware on the computer. Once the process is complete,
                monitor the computer again to confirm that there are no further
                issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                To help ensure that a malware infection doesn’t happen again
                threat definitions should be set to update automatically, and to
                automatically scan for and quarantine suspected malware.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the malware has been removed from the computer, you should
                turn back on the automatic backup tool and manually create a
                safe restore point. If the computer needs attention in the
                future, this new restore point is confirmed safe and clean.
              </p>
              <h5>Malware education</h5>
              <p>
                One of the most important things an IT professional can do to
                protect a company and its employees is to educate users about
                malware. The goal of education is to stop malware from ever
                gaining access to company systems. Here are a few ways users and
                IT professionals can protect their computer and the company from
                malware:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Keep the computer and software updated</li>
                <li>Use a non-administrator account whenever possible</li>
                <li>
                  Think twice before clicking links or downloading anything
                </li>
                <li>Be careful about opening email attachments or images</li>
                <li>
                  Don't trust pop-up windows that ask to download software
                </li>
                <li>Limit your file-sharing</li>
                <li>Use antivirus software</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When all employees are on the lookout for suspicious files, it’s
                much easier to prevent malware and viruses from taking hold.
              </p>
              <p>
                As malware gets more sophisticated, the chance of malware
                eventually infecting the computers you manage becomes more
                likely. These steps will help you when and if that time comes.
              </p>
              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                Malware can be devastating for a company’s computer network. As
                an IT support professional, you should be familiar with how to
                detect, isolate, and remove malware from the computers you
                manage.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  An infected device should be isolated from the local network
                  and internet as soon as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Antivirus and Anti-Malware software is a key tool for
                  detecting and removing malware.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keeping threat protection software updated makes malware
                  removal faster and easier.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Education is the first and best line of defense against
                  malware.

              <h4>Malware Continued</h4>

              Let's pick up where we left off with Malware. So far, we've
              covered some of the major types of Malware that can be found on a
              system, including Malware, viruses, worms, adware, spyware,
              ransomware. What if our attackers could not only do malicious
              things like steal our data, but they can also steal our computer's
              resources like the CPU?
              <img src="image/5/steal-comp-resources.jpeg" alt="" />
              Well, I'm sorry to tell you that actually exists. There is Malware
              out there that can utilize someone else's machine to perform a
              task that is centrally controlled by the attacker. These
              compromised machines are known as bots. If there are a collection
              of one or more bots, we call that network of devices a botnet.
              Botnets are designed to utilize the power of the internet
              connected machines to perform some distributed function. Take
              mining Bitcoin, for example. Mining Bitcoin requires a machine to
              perform some computation that takes up your machine's resources.
              At the end, you may be rewarded with some amount of Bitcoin. A
              popular attack has been creating botnets to do stuff like mine
              Bitcoins. So instead of having one computer run computations,
              attackers can now have a 1,000 computers running computations and
              raking in more and more Bitcoin. A backdoor is a way to get into a
              system if the other methods to get in a system aren't allowed.
              It's a secret entryway for attackers. Backdoors are most commonly
              installed after an attacker has gained access to your system and
              wants to maintain that access, even if you discovered your system
              has been compromised, you may not realize that a backdoor to your
              system exists. If it does, you need to lock it up before more
              damage can be done. Another form of Malware that can be
              particularly problematic is a rootkit. A rootkit, by its name, is
              a kit for root, meaning a collection of software or tools that an
              admin would use. It allows admin level modification to an
              operating system. A rootkit can be hard to detect because they can
              hide itself from the system using the system itself. Sneaky little
              sucker. The rootkit can be running lots of malicious processes.
              But at the same time, those processes wouldn't show up in Task
              Manager because it can hide its own presence. A logic bomb is a
              type of Malware that's intentionally installed after a certain
              event or time has triggered, it will run the malicious program.
              There's a popular logic bomb case that happened in 2006, where an
              unhappy systems administrator at a bank set off a logic bomb and
              brought down accompanies services in an attempt to drop their
              stock prices. The former employee was caught and charged with
              fraud, then sentenced to eight years in prison. Not the most
              logical logic bomb.

            <h3 class="article__title">Network Attacks</h3>
            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Network Attacks</h4>
              A network attack that is simple in concept but can cause a lot of
              damage is a DNS cache poisoning attack. DNS cache poisoning attack
              works by tricking a DNS server into accepting a fake DNS record
              that will point you to a compromised DNS server. It then feeds you
              fake DNS addresses when you try to access legitimate websites. Not
              only that, DNS cache poisoning can spread to other networks too.
              If other DNS servers are getting their DNS information from a
              compromised server, they'll serve those bad DNS entries to other
              hosts. Several years ago, there was a large scale DNS cache
              poisoning attack in Brazil. It appeared that attackers managed to
              poison the DNS cache of some local ISPs by inserting fake DNS
              records for various popular websites like Google, Gmail or
              Hotmail. When someone attempted to visit one of those sites, they
              were served a fake DNS record an were sent to a server that the
              attacker controlled which hosted a small Java applet. The user
              would then be tricked into installing the applet which was
              actually a malicious banking trojan designed to steal banking
              credentials. This is an example of the real world damage DNS cache
              poisoning attacks can pose. A man in the middle attack is an
              attack that places the attacker in the middle of two hosts that
              think they're communicating directly with each other. It's clearly
              a name that needs some updating, men aren't the only hackers out
              there. The attack will monitor the information going to and from
              these hosts and potentially modify it in transit.
              <img src="image/5/man-in-the-middle.jpeg" alt="" />
              A common man in the middle attack is a session hijacking or cookie
              hijacking, let's say you log into a website and forget to log out.
              Now you've already authenticated yourself to the website and
              generated a session token that grants you access to that website.
              If someone was performing a session hijacking, they could steal
              that token and impersonate you on the website and no one wants
              that. This is another reason to think about the CIAs of security.
              You always want to make sure that the data that you are sending or
              receiving has integrity and isn't being tampered with. Another
              way, a man in the middle attack can be established is a rogue
              access point attack. A rogue AP is an access point that is
              installed on the network without the network administrators
              knowledge. Sometimes in corporate environments, someone may plug a
              router into their corporate network to create a simple wireless
              network. Innocent enough, right wrong. This can actually be pretty
              dangerous and could grant unauthorized access to an authorized
              secure network. Instead of an attacker having to gain access to a
              network by plugging directly into a network code. They can just
              stand outside the building and hop onto this wireless network.
              <img src="image/5/stand-outside.jpeg" alt="" />
              A final man in the middle method will cover is called an Evil
              Twin. It's similar to the rogue AP example but has a small but
              important difference. The premise of an Evil twin attack is for
              you to connect to a network that is identical to yours. This
              identical network is our networks Evil twin and is controlled by
              our attacker. Once we connect to it, they will be able to monitor
              our traffic.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Denial-of-Service</h4>

              A denial-of-service or DoS attack is an attack that tries to
              prevent access to a service for legitimate users by overwhelming
              the network or server. Think about how you normally get on a
              website. Most major websites are capable of serving millions of
              users, but for this example, imagine you have a website that could
              only serve ten users. If someone was performing a denial of
              service attack, they would just take up all ten of those spots and
              legitimate users would have been denied the service because
              there's no more room for them.
              <img src="image/5/dos-attack.jpeg" alt="" />
              Now apply that to a website like google or Facebook DoS attacks
              try to take up those resources of the service and prevent real
              users from accessing it, not a pretty picture. The ping of death
              or pod is a pretty simple example of a DoS attack. It works by
              sending a malformed ping to a computer. The ping would be larger
              in size than what the internet protocol was made to handle. So it
              results in a buffer overflow. This can cause the system to crash
              and potentially allow the execution of malicious code. Another
              example is a ping flood which sends tons of ping packets to a
              system. More specifically, it sends ICMP echo requests since a
              ping expects an equal number of ICMP echo replies. If a computer
              can't keep up with this, then it's prone to being overwhelmed and
              taken down. Not cool ping flood, not cool.
              <img src="image/5/pink-flood.jpeg" alt="" />
              Similar to a ping flood is a SNC flood. Remember that to make a
              TCP connection, a client sends a SYN packet to a server, it wants
              to connect to next, the server sends back a SYN-ACK message. Then
              the client sends an ACK message. In a SYN flood, the server is
              being bombarded with these sim packets. The server is sending back
              SYN-ACK packets, but the attacker is not sending ACK messages.
              This means that the connection stays open and is taking up the
              server's resources. Other users will be unable to connect to the
              server, which is a big problem, since the TCP connection is half
              open we also refer to SYN floods as half open attacks.
              <img src="image/5/snc-flood.jpeg" alt="" />
              Sounds messy, right? It is, the DoS attacks we've learned about so
              far only use a single machine to carry out an attack. But what if
              Attackers could utilize multiple machines? A much scarier
              scenario, they'd be able to take down services in greater volumes
              and even quicker rates. Even scarier attackers can absolutely do
              that. A DoS attack using multiple systems is called a distributed
              denial of service attack or DDoS, it need a large volume of
              systems to carry out an attack. And they're usually helped by
              botnet attackers, in that scenario, they can gain access to large
              volumes of machines to perform an attack. In October of 2016 a
              DDoS attack occurred when the DNS service provider DYN was the
              target of a DDoS, fake DNS look up requests along with SYN floods
              that botnets were performing overloaded their system. DYN handled
              the DNS for major websites like Reddit, Git hub, Twitter, etc. So
              once it went down, it also took down its customers, making those
              services inaccessible, don't get between people and their Reddit
              threads or Twitter feeds. I know from experience, it's not pretty.

              <h4>Client-Side Attacks</h4>

              We've talked a lot about security attacks that target victims
              directly, but they aren't the only type of attacks that occur in
              the web. One day you may find yourself in software development or
              software engineering and you'll need to know about these other
              types of attacks in order to ensure the security of your work. A
              common security exploit that can occur in software development and
              runs rampant on the web is the possibility for an attacker to
              inject malicious code. We refer to these types of attacks as
              injection attacks. So how do injection attacks work? Great
              question. For simplicity sake, we won't get into the details of
              the code implementation but imagine a car. You keep your car
              running by putting gas in it. Now consider someone who wants to do
              something malicious to that car. That person could inject your gas
              tank with a strawberry banana milkshake. While that may sound
              delicious, it could also ruin your car. So how do you fight
              against that? A hypothetical method to prevent this is adding a
              mechanism to your car that only accepts gasoline and no other
              liquids. Injection attacks and websites work the exact same way
              except without the mouthwatering strawberry banana milkshakes and
              without having overly complex solutions. Injection attacks can be
              mitigated with good software development principles like
              validating input and sanitizing data. Is anyone else getting
              hungry, milkshake break? No, okay, we'll move on. Cross-site
              scripting or XSS attacks are a type of injection attack where the
              attacker can insert malicious code and target the user of the
              service. XSS attacks are a common method to achieve a session
              hijacking. It would be as simple as embedding a malicious script
              in a website and the user unknowingly executes the scripts in
              their browser. The script could then do malicious things like
              steal a victim's cookies and have access to a log into a website
              cookies. Another type of injection attack is a sequel or SQL
              injection attack. Unlike an XSS that targets a user, SQL injection
              attack targets the entire website if the website is using a SQL
              database. Attackers can potentially run SQL commands that allow
              them to delete website data, copy it and run other malicious
              commands. Now that that's out of the w

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Password Attacks</h4>

              There's no getting around it. Passwords are the most secure common
              safeguards we have to prevent unauthorized account access.
              Unfortunately, our passwords may not be as secure or strong as
              they should be. A common attack that occurs to gain access to an
              account is a password attack. Password attacks utilize software
              like password-crackers that try and guess your password. They
              worked extremely well, so don't try to reuse that Fido password.
              It didn't secure your bank account and it's not going to work
              here. Moving on. A common password attack is a brute force attack
              which just continuously tries different combinations of characters
              and letters until it gets access. Since this attack requires
              testing a lot of combinations of passwords, it usually it takes a
              while to do this. Have you ever seen a CAPTCHA when logging into a
              website? CAPTCHA are used to distinguish a real human from a
              machine. They ask things like, are you human or are you a robot,
              or are you a dancer? In a password attack, if you didn't have a
              CAPTCHA available, an automated system can just keep trying to
              login to your account until it found the right password
              combination. But with a CAPTCHA, it prevents these attacks from
              executing. Another type of password attack is a dictionary attack.
              A dictionary attack doesn't test out brute-force combinations like
              abc1 or ABC1. Instead, it tries out words that are commonly used
              and passwords like password, monkey football. The best way to
              prevent a password attack is to utilize strong passwords. Don't
              include real words you would find in a dictionary and make sure to
              use a mix of capitals, letters, and symbols. Without any fail
              safes like CAPTCHA or other account protections, it would take a
              typical password cracker application about one minute to crack a
              password like "sandwich", but substantially longer to crack
              something like what you see here. Spelled s-&-n-D-w-h the number
              1, c then another h. See how that's the same, but also way harder
              to crack?

              <h4>Deceptive Attacks</h4>

              Get ready because we're about to dive into one of the least
              technical but most disturbing attacks that can be done, social
              engineering. Social engineering is an attack method that relies
              heavily on interactions with humans instead of computers. You can
              harden your defenses as much as you want. You can spend millions
              of dollars on state-of-the-art security infrastructure. But if
              Susan, the systems administrator, has all the access to your
              system and gets tricked into handling over her credentials,
              there's nothing you can do to stop it. As we've learned from the
              greatest sci-fi movies, humans will always be the weakest link in
              life and in your security system. Social engineering is a con game
              where attackers use deceptive techniques to gain access to
              personal information. They then try to have a user execute
              something and basically scam a victim into doing that thing. A
              popular type of social engineering attack is a phishing attack.
              Phishing usually occurs when a malicious email is sent to a victim
              disguised as something legitimate. One common phishing attack is
              an email saying your bank account has been compromised. It then
              gives you a link to click on to reset your password. When you go
              to the link, it looks like your bank's website, but it's actually
              a fake website so your tricked into entering your current password
              and credentials in order to reset your current password. Another
              variation of phishing is spear phishing. Both phishing schemes
              have the same end goals, but spear phishing specifically targets
              individual or group. The fake emails may contain some personal
              information like your name or the names of friends or family, so
              they seem more trustworthy. Another popular social engineering
              attack is email spoofing. Spoofing is when a source is
              masquerading around as something else. Think of an email spoof.
              This is what happens when you receive an email with a misleading
              sender address. You can send an email and have it appear to come
              from anywhere you want, whether it exists or not. Imagine if you
              open the email you thought was from your friend Brian. Brian's
              real email address is in the front part and the email says that
              you have to check out this funny link. Well, you know, Brian, he's
              pretty awesome and he always send super funny emails so you click
              on the link, suddenly you have malware installed and you're
              probably not feeling so awesome about Brian right now. Not all
              social engineering occurs digitally. In fact, one attack happens
              through actual physical contact. This is called baiting, which is
              used to entice the victim to do something. For example, an
              attacker could just leave a USB drive somewhere in hopes that
              someone out there will plug it into their machine to see what's on
              it. But they've just installed malware on their machine without
              even knowing it. Another popular attack that can occur offline is
              called tailgating, which is essentially gaining access into a
              restricted area or building following a real employee in. In most
              corporate environments, building access is restricted through the
              use of a key card or some other entry method. A tailgate or could
              use social engineering tactics to trick an employee into thinking
              that they're there for a legitimate reason, like doing maintenance
              on the building or delivering packages. Once the tailgater is in,
              they have physical access to your corporate assets. Pretty scary
              stuff we've covered so far. I bet you didn't realize that there
              were so many ways to compromise security. Hopefully, you've gained
              a better grasp on the common attacks out there and signs on what
              to look for.

              <h4>Deceptive Attacks</h4>
              <p>
                Previously, you learned about the dangers of socially engineered
                deceptive attacks. In this reading, you will review this topic
                and learn about a few more types of socially engineered
                deceptive attacks. Social engineering attacks are unique as
                compared to other types of attacks. Social engineering requires
                cybercriminals to use psychology to trick victims into providing
                information to the cybercriminal. In other types of cyber
                attacks, the cybercriminals use computers and other digital
                tools to hack computers and networks without engaging and
                deceiving individual victims.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cybercriminals may use deceptive attacks to disguise their
                identities, intents, and motives. Through social engineering
                techniques, these cybercriminals attempt to trick victims into
                revealing private information, such as a credit card number or
                login credentials. The cybercriminal might disguise their
                identity by pretending to be from a reputable organization or to
                be an individual that the victim might trust, like a friend or
                work colleague. Socially engineered deceptive attacks can happen
                through websites, email, text messaging, phone calls, in-person
                interactions, and more. Cybercriminals often find deception
                through social engineering to be an easy means for hacking a
                computer system, simply because many technology users are not
                aware that this type of threat exists. Others may be aware of
                the potential for a deceptive cybercriminal attack, but are not
                sure how to recognize the deception and, further, to prevent
                themselves from being deceived
              </p>
              <p>
                Social engineering attacks have increased in recent years. These
                attacks have changed how organizations approach their
                cybersecurity policies. It is important for organizations to
                train their employees on how to recognize a deceptive attack. A
                single employee that is tricked into entering their company
                login and password into a fake login window could create an
                opportunity for a catastrophic criminal attack against an
                organization’s network.
              </p>
              <h5>Deceptive attacks over the internet</h5>
              <p>
                There are many types of social engineering attacks. Some of the
                more common attacks include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Phishing: A cybercriminal may use email and text messaging to
                  “fish” or phish for victims that will take the cybercriminal’s
                  bait. One basic type of phishing bait may include a convincing
                  story to trick the victim into replying to the email with
                  personal or sensitive information. Another common phishing
                  scam includes using “clickbait” links. These phishing messages
                  entice victims to click on a link by using bait such as
                  popular pet videos, gossip, news scandals, opportunities to
                  win money or prizes, lewd images or videos, etc. If the
                  recipient clicks on the link, they become victim to the next
                  phase of the malicious attack, which could be some type of
                  forced download of malware, ransomware, viruses, keyloggers,
                  trackers, and more.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spoofing: Cybercriminals use this technique to alter the
                  header on phishing emails in order to appear to originate from
                  a legitimate business or reputable person. For example, a
                  spoofed email might use a fake header that appears to be from
                  a bank. The body of the email might ask the victim to click a
                  given link to log into their bank account to fix a “problem”.
                  The link leads to the cybercriminal’s fake website that looks
                  identical to the bank website and exists only to collect the
                  bank login credentials from victims. The fake website might
                  even give the victim an error message and forward them to the
                  real bank to try to login again. This technique keeps the
                  victim from immediately recognizing they have been scammed
                  because the second login attempt on the real website is
                  usually successful.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spear phishing: A cybercriminal might use details about a
                  victim’s life to win the victim’s trust. For example, the
                  criminal might first purchase data from a social media
                  platform that provides personal information about the
                  platform’s users. The cybercriminal then uses this data to
                  target or “spear” specific individuals. The cybercriminal
                  could select a name from a user’s friends list and create a
                  spoofed email that appears to be from that friend. The spoofed
                  email may say something as simple as, “look at this photo I
                  found of you online!” The email may also include an attachment
                  or a clickbait link that leads to the next stage of the
                  attack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whaling: When a cybercriminal wants to spear phish a big
                  target or “whale,” they will spend more time and effort
                  deceiving the victim. A whale target is typically someone in a
                  position of power, such as a wealthy and/or famous person, an
                  executive of a company, or a high-level government employee.
                  The whale is targeted because of the likelihood that they have
                  the ability to pay high ransomware fees, trade valuable
                  information or confidential data, or may be vulnerable to
                  blackmail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vishing: Cybercriminals use Voice over IP (VoIP) to make phone
                  calls or leave voice messages pretending to be from reputable
                  companies in order to trick victims into revealing personal
                  information, such as banking details and credit card numbers.
                  Although telephone scams have been running for decades,
                  vishing with VoIP makes it easier for cybercriminals to hide
                  their true identity. VoIP calls are significantly more
                  difficult to trace than landline calls.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Targeted and in-person deceptive attacks</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Shoulder surfing: This malicious attack might have a specific
                  victim or organization as their target. Shoulder surfing
                  happens when a person looks over a victim’s shoulder to watch
                  them enter login credentials, credit card numbers, or other
                  sensitive information. For example, a temporary contractor for
                  an organization may look over the shoulder of an employee to
                  watch the employee enter their login info. The temporary
                  employee’s goal might be to steal credentials in order to
                  illegally obtain confidential company data or plant
                  ransomware.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tailgating: This in-person attack is a form of social
                  engineering in which an unauthorized party gains physical
                  access to a restricted area by simply following a person or
                  group of persons who have authorized access. For example, a
                  criminal wanting to gain physical access to an organization’s
                  computer network might dress in business clothing and follow a
                  group of coworkers coming back from lunch. One member of the
                  group may use their key card to open the door, then hold the
                  door open for the rest of the group, as well as the criminal
                  who is dressed and behaving as though they belong in the
                  building. The criminal may even have a fake ID card to show
                  anyone who questions them.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Impersonation: This attack might happen over email, text
                  messaging, or a phone call. The attacker impersonates someone
                  who should have access to an organization’s computer network.
                  For example, the attacker might call the IT Support team to
                  request help with a password reset. Alternatively, the
                  attacker might pretend to be a member of an organization’s IT
                  Support team. They may call an employee to ask them to change
                  some settings on their computer to fix a fake problem. These
                  changes are intended to open a door for the cybercriminal to
                  gain access to the organization’s network.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Dumpster Diving: This in-person attack involves the attacker
                  literally digging through the trash of an individual or
                  organization to hunt for confidential information, like
                  financial or customer information. Shredding all confidential
                  documents is an easy way to prevent this type of attack.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Evil twin: This type of attack involves the cybercriminal
                  installing Wi-Fi routers that appear to belong to an
                  organization's network. These Wi-Fi access points may not
                  require a password and might appear to offer a stronger signal
                  than the real Wi-Fi router. When victims connect to the fake
                  Wi-Fi access point, the cybercriminal gains access to the
                  victim’s wireless transmissions, which can include login
                  credentials and other sensitive information.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As an IT Support professional, it is important to train the
                people and organizations you support on how to identify and
                protect from socially engineered attacks. These training
                sessions should be offered to all new employees, contractors,
                and anyone else who may have access to the organization’s
                network. Additionally, the training sessions should be repeated
                on a frequent schedule as new, more sophisticated cybercrime
                techniques emerge. One best practice method for keeping network
                users always on alert for attacks, is for IT Support staff to
                periodically stage harmless attacks that target network users.
                This method is used to test how effective the training classes
                have been and how long the users are able to recall how to
                protect themselves against an attack. Instead of stealing the
                user’s private information, the harmless attack makes users
                aware that they fell for a scam, and provides reminders on how
                to protect themselves against real cybercriminal attacks in the
                future.

                  Equipment locks can restrict the movement of sensitive
                  equipment, like servers, storage media, or terminals, by
                  anchoring them to a less mobile structure. Only people with an
                  authorized unlocking mechanism, like a key or security badge,
                  can release the controlled equipment from its anchored
                  location.

                  surveillance can document who accesses a controlled area, how
                  they access it, and what they do there.

              <h4>Cryptography</h4>

              When you were little, did you and your siblings ever communicate
              in a secret language around your parents? It didn't really matter
              what you were talking about, as long as your parents didn't know
              what it was. That was the fun part. It may have seemed like a fun
              game when you were younger, but for as long as humans have been
              around, we've created ways to keep messages secret from others. In
              this lesson, we'll cover how this plays out through symmetric
              encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing. We'll also go over
              how to describe the most common algorithms in cryptography and
              learn how to choose the most appropriate cryptographic method in
              any given scenario. But before we dive into the nitty-gritty
              details of cryptography, the various types that exist in our
              applications, let's go over some terminology and general
              principles that will help you understand the details later. The
              topic of cryptography or hiding messages from potential enemies
              has been around for thousands of years. It's evolved tremendously
              with the advent of modern technology, computers, and
              telecommunications. Encryption is the act of taking a message
              called plaintext and applying an operation to it called a cipher
              so that you receive a garbled, unreadable message as the output
              called ciphertext. The reverse process, taking the garbled output
              and transforming it back into the readable plaintext, is called
              decryption. For example, let's look at a simple cipher where we
              substitute e for o and o for y. We'll take the plaintext "Hello,
              World!" and feed it into our basic cipher. What do you think the
              resulting ciphertext will be? Hopefully, you've got Holly Wyrld.
              It's pretty easy to decipher this ciphertext, since this is a very
              basic example. A cipher is actually made up of two components, the
              encryption algorithm and the key. The encryption algorithm is the
              underlying logic or process that's used to convert the plaintext
              into ciphertext. These algorithms are usually very complex
              mathematical operations, but there are also some very basic
              algorithms that we can take a closer look at that don't
              necessarily require a PhD in math to understand. The other crucial
              component of a cipher is the key, which introduces something
              unique into your cipher. Without the key, anyone using the same
              algorithm would be able to decode your message and you wouldn't
              actually have any secrecy. To recap, first, you pick an encryption
              algorithm you'd like to use to encode your message, then choose a
              key. Now you have a cipher which you can run your plaintext
              message through and get an encrypted ciphertext out, ready to be
              sent out into the world, safe and secure from prying eyes. Doesn't
              this make you feel like an international person of mystery? Just
              wait. Given that the underlying purpose of cryptography is to
              protect your secrets from being read by unauthorized parties, it
              would make sense that at least some of the components of a cipher
              will need to be kept secret too. You can make the argument that by
              keeping the algorithm secret, your messages are secured from
              snooping third parties, and technically you wouldn't be wrong.
              This general concept is referred to as security through obscurity,
              which basically means if no one knows what algorithm we're using
              or general security practice, then we're safe from attackers.
              Think of hiding your house key under your doormat. As long as the
              burglar doesn't know that you hide a spare key under the mat,
              you're safe. But once that information is discovered, all security
              goes out the window along with your valuables. Clearly, security
              through obscurity isn't something that you should rely on for
              securing communication or systems or for your house for that
              matter. This overall concept of cryptography is referred to as
              Kerckhoff's principle. This principle states that a cryptosystem
              or a collection of algorithms for key generation and encryption
              and decryption operations that comprise a cryptographic service
              should remain secure, even if everything about the system is known
              except for the key. What this means is that even if your enemy
              knows the exact encryption algorithm you use to secure your data,
              they're still unable to recover the plaintext from an intercepted
              ciphertext. You may also hear this principle referred to as
              Shannon's maxim or the enemy knows the system. The implications
              are the same. The system should remain secure, even if your
              adversary knows exactly what kind of encryption systems you're
              employing as long as your keys remain secure. We already defined
              encryption, but the overarching discipline that covers the
              practice of coding and hiding messages from third parties is
              called cryptography. The study of this practice is referred to as
              cryptology. The opposite of this, looking for hidden messages or
              trying to decipher coded message, is referred to as cryptanalysis.
              These two fields have co-evolved throughout history with new
              ciphers and cryptosystems being developed as previous ones were
              broken or found to be vulnerable. One of the earliest recorded
              descriptions of cryptanalysis is from a 9th century Arabian
              mathematician who described a method for frequency analysis to
              break coded messages. Frequency analysis is the practice of
              studying the frequency with which letters appear in ciphertext.
              The premise behind this type of analysis is that in written
              languages, certain letters appear more frequently than others and
              some letters are more commonly grouped together than others. For
              example, the most commonly used letters in the English language
              are e, t, a, and o. The most commonly seen pairs of these letters
              are th, er, on, and an. Some ciphers, especially classical
              transposition and substitution ciphers, preserve the relative
              frequency of letters in the plaintext, and so are potentially
              vulnerable to this type of analysis. During World War I and World
              War II, cryptography and cryptanalysis played an increasingly
              important role. There was a shift away from linguistics and
              frequency analysis and a move towards more mathematical-based
              analysis. This was due to more complex and sophisticated ciphers
              being developed. A major turning point in the field of
              cryptanalysis was during World War II when the US allies began to
              incorporate sophisticated mathematics to aid in breaking axis
              encryption schemes. This also saw the first use of automation
              technology applied to cryptanalysis in England at Bletchley Park.
              The first programmable digital computer named Colossus was
              developed to aid in this effort. While early computers were
              applied to breaking cryptography, this opened the door for a huge
              leap forward in the development of even more sophisticated and
              complex cryptosystems. Steganography is a related practice, but
              distinctly different from cryptography. It's the practice of
              hiding information from observers but not encoding it. Think of
              writing a message using invisible ink. The message is in plaintext
              and no decoding is necessary to read the text, but the text is
              hidden from sight. The ink is invisible and must be made visible
              using a mechanism known to the recipient. Modern steganographic
              techniques include embedding messages and even files into other
              files, like images or videos, to a casual observer. They would
              just see a picture of a cute puppy. But if you feed that image
              into steganography software, it would extract a message hidden
              within the image file. What's not so secret is how fun it is to
              learn about all the spice stuff, don't you think? Required en ​

              <h4>Supplemental Reading for The Future of Cryptanalysis</h4>
              <p>
                Data security is one of the top issues for companies. Being
                familiar with how data is protected and the attacks that can
                occur within a company to get sensitive information is a crucial
                aspect of an IT professionals role. This reading covers the
                definitions of cryptography and cryptanalysis as well as the
                five types of attacks and their outcomes.
              </p>

              <h6>Cryptography</h6>
              <p>
                Cryptography is a method of protecting information and
                communications using codes so that only the intended person can
                read and process them. Cryptography has mainly stemmed from the
                manual encoding of messages and information using a formula to
                convert any given letter or number to a new value. Encryption is
                the process that encodes the data making it harder to decode.
                The goal of encrypting data is to keep internal information
                secure.
              </p>

              <h6>Cryptanalysis</h6>
              <p>
                Cryptanalysis uses technology to improve the process of
                encrypting data and innovates new ways to defend companies from
                attacks that can access and decode their data.
              </p>
              <h5>Impact of technology</h5>
              <p>
                Many modern encryption algorithms are based on large prime
                number factorization. This factorization is difficult to do by
                hand since there are millions of options for these algorithms.
                Once the information has been encrypted using the algorithm, it
                is called ciphertext. Technology has evolved to create harder
                algorithms but also makes it easier to crack algorithms. Modern
                quantum computers can crack encryption keys significantly faster
                using factorization and brute-force attacks. An encryption key
                is typically a random string of bits generated specifically to
                scramble and unscramble data. The encryption key is then used to
                convert the ciphertext to plaintext, which is not encoded.
              </p>

              <h5>Types of cryptanalysis attack</h5>
              <p>
                There are several types of attacks that hackers or security
                professionals employ to get data from a network using
                cryptanalysis. The attacks all use a different way into the
                network to gain encoded information and translate it from the
                encoded form into information that can be easily read.
              </p>

              <p>The following are the most common cryptanalytic attacks:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Known-Plaintext Analysis (KPA) requires access to some or all
                  of the plaintext of the encrypted information. The plaintext
                  is not computationally tagged, specially formatted, or written
                  in code. The analyst's goal is to examine the known plaintext
                  to determine the key used to encrypt the message. Then they
                  use the key to decrypt the encoded information.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Chosen-Plaintext Analysis (CPA) requires that the attacker
                  knows the encryption algorithm or has access to the device
                  used to do the encryption. The analyst can encrypt one block
                  of chosen plaintext with the targeted algorithm to get
                  information about the key. Once the analyst obtains the key,
                  they can decrypt and use sensitive information.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ciphertext-Only Analysis (COA) requires access to one or more
                  encrypted messages. No information is needed about the
                  plaintext data, the algorithm, or data about the cryptographic
                  key. Intelligence agencies face this challenge when
                  intercepting encrypted communications with no key.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Adaptive Chosen-Plaintext Attack (ACPA) is similar to a
                  chosen-plaintext attack. Unlike a CPA, it can use smaller
                  lines of plaintext to receive its encrypted ciphertext and
                  then crack the encryption code using the ciphertext.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Meddler-in-the-Middle (MITM) uses cryptanalysts to insert a
                  meddler between two communication devices or applications to
                  exchange their keys for secure communication. The meddler
                  replies as the user and then performs a key exchange with each
                  party. The users or systems think they communicate with each
                  other, not the meddler. These attacks allow the meddler to
                  obtain login credentials and other sensitive information.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Results from a cryptanalysis attack</h5>
              <p>
                There are various results of a cryptanalysis attack. Some
                attacks result in a total break in the encryption and some
                result in more information that can help the attacker cause
                other damage or get closer to the goal of a total break.
              </p>

              <p>Common results from a cryptanalysis attack include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Instance deduction where the attacker discovers additional
                  plain or cipher text. While the key isn’t found to break the
                  code, the additional plaintext or ciphertext can be used to
                  cause problems or continue attacks.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Information deduction where the attacker obtains some
                  information about plain or cipher text not previously known.
                  The additional information can lead to more information about
                  the encryption key.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Distinguishing algorithm where the attacker can distinguish
                  the encryption algorithm from a random alteration. This
                  information reveals clues about the encryption algorithm and
                  can lead to more significant breaks.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Global deduction where the attacker finds an algorithm that is
                  functionally equivalent to the one used in the key. This
                  algorithm is then used to decrypt all information and
                  messages.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Total break where the attacker can gain the entire key. With
                  the entire key, the attacker can decrypt all messages and
                  information.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Technology has advanced cryptanalysis, using more complex
                  algorithms to encrypt data. Modern quantum computers also make
                  it easier to use cryptanalysis to break a company’s
                  encryption.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The different types of attacks that focus on plaintext and
                  ciphertext are Known-Plaintext Analysis, Chosen-Plaintext
                  Analysis, Ciphertext-Only Analysis, and Adaptive
                  Chosen-Plaintext Attack. The meddler in the middle attack is
                  another cryptanalysis attack that gets the key from
                  intercepting a key exchange.

              <h4>Symmetric Cryptography</h4>

              So far, we've been talking pretty generally about cryptographic
              systems and focusing primarily on encryption concepts but not
              decryption. It makes sense that if you're sending a protected
              message to someone, you'd want your recipient to be able to decode
              the message and read it, and maybe even reply with a coded message
              of their own. Let's check out the first broad category of
              encryption algorithms, and dive into more details about how it
              works, along with some pros and cons. When we covered Kerckhoff's
              principle earlier, do you remember which component of the cipher
              is crucial to keep secret? That's right, the key must be kept
              private to ensure that an eavesdropper wouldn't be able to decode
              encrypted messages. In this scenario, we're making the assumption
              that the algorithm in use is what's referred to as symmetric key
              algorithm. These types of encryption algorithms are called
              symmetric because they use the same key to encrypt and decrypt
              messages. Let's take a simple example of a symmetric key
              encryption algorithm to walk through the overall process of
              encrypting and decrypting a message. A substitution cipher is an
              encryption mechanism that replaces parts of your plain text with
              ciphertexts. Remember our Hello World example from earlier, that's
              an example of substitution cipher. Since we're substituting some
              characters with different ones. In this case, the key would be the
              mapping of characters between plaintext and ciphertext. Without
              knowing what letters get replaced with, you wouldn't be able to
              easily decode the ciphertext and recover the plaintext. If you
              have the key or the substitution table, then you can easily
              reverse the process and decrypt the coded message by just
              performing the reverse operation. A well-known example of a
              substitution cipher is the Caesar cipher, which is a substitution
              alphabet. In this case, you're replacing characters in the
              alphabet with others, usually by shifting or rotating the
              alphabet, a set of numbers or characters. The number of the offset
              is the key. Another popular example of this is referred to as
              ROT13 or ROT13, where the alphabet is rotated 13 places. But
              really ROT13 is a Caesar cipher that uses a key of 13. Let's go
              back to our Hello World example and walk through encoding it using
              our ROT13 cipher. Our ciphertexts winds up being, URYYB JBEYQ. To
              reverse this process and go back to the plain texts, we just
              perform the reverse operation by looking up the characters in the
              output side of the mapping table. You might notice something about
              the ROT13 mapping table, or the fact that we're offsetting the
              alphabet by 13 characters. Thirteen is exactly half of the
              alphabet. This results in the ROT13 cipher being an inverse of
              itself. What this means is that you can recover the plaintext from
              ciphertexts by performing the ROT13 operation on the ciphertexts.
              There are two more categories that symmetric key ciphers can be
              placed into. There either block ciphers or their stream ciphers.
              This relates to how the ciphers operate on the plain text to be
              encrypted. A Stream cipher, as the name implies, takes a stream of
              input and encrypts the stream one character or one digit at a
              time, outputting one encrypted character or digit at a time.
              There's a one-to-one relationship between data in an encrypted
              data out. The other category of symmetric ciphers is Block
              ciphers. The cipher takes data in, places it into a bucket or
              block of data that's a fixed size, then encodes that entire block
              as one unit. If the data to be encrypted isn't big enough to fill
              the block, the extra space will be padded to ensure the plain text
              fits into the blocks evenly. Now, generally speaking, stream
              ciphers are faster and less complex to implement, but they can be
              less secure than block ciphers if the key generation and handling
              isn't done properly. If the same key is used to encrypt data two
              or more times, it's possible to break the cipher, and to recover
              the plaintext. To avoid key reuse, initialization vector or IV is
              used. That's a bit of random data that's integrated into the
              encryption key, and the resulting combined key is then used to
              encrypt the data. The idea behind this is, if you have one shared
              master key, then generate a onetime encryption key. That
              encryption key is used only once by generating a new key using the
              master one and the IV. In order for the encrypted message to be
              decoded, the IV must be sent in plain text along with the
              encrypted message. A good example of this can be seen when
              inspecting the 802.11 frame of a web encrypted wireless packet.
              The IV is included in plain text right before the encrypted data
              payload.

              <h4>Symmetric Encryption Algorithms</h4>
              In the last section, we covered the basics of what exactly
              symmetric encryption algorithms are and give a basic example of
              the Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher. We couldn't
              possibly protect anything of value using the cipher though. There
              must be more complex and secure symmetric algorithms. Of course,
              there are. One of the earliest encryption standards is DES, which
              stands for Data Encryption Standard. DES was designed in the 1970s
              by IBM with some input from the US National Security Agency. DES
              was adopted as an official FIPS, Federal Information Processing
              Standard for the US. This means that DES was adopted as a federal
              standard for encrypting and securing government data. DES is a
              symmetric block cipher that uses 64 bit key sizes and operates on
              blocks 64 bits in size. Though key size is technically 64 bits in
              length, eight bits are used only for parity checking. A simple
              form of error checking. This means that real-world key length for
              DES is only 56 bits. A quick note about encryption key sizes in
              symmetric encryption algorithms, the same key is used to encrypt
              as to decrypt everything else being the same. The key is a unique
              piece that protects your data and the symmetric key must be kept
              secret to ensure the confidentiality of the data being protected.
              The key size defined in bits is the total number of bits or data
              that comprises the encryption key. So you can think of the key
              size as the upper limit for the total possible keys for a given
              encryption algorithm. Key length is super-important in
              cryptography since it essentially defines the maximum potential
              strength of the system. Imagine an ideal symmetric encryption
              algorithm where there are no flaws or weaknesses in the algorithm
              itself. In this scenario, the only possible way for an adversary
              to break your encryption would be to attack the key instead of the
              algorithm. One attack method is to just guess the key and see if
              the message decodes correctly. This is referred to as a brute
              force attack. Longer key length protect against this type of
              attack. Let's take the DES key as an example, 64 bits long minus
              the eight parity bits gives us a key length of 56 bits. This means
              that there are a maximum of 2^56 power or 72 quadrillion possible
              keys. That seems like a ton of keys and back in the 1970s, it was.
              But as technology advanced and computers got faster and more
              efficient, 64 bit keys quickly proved to be too small. What were
              once only theoretical attacks on the key size became reality in
              1998 when the EFF, Electronic Frontier Foundation decrypted a DES
              encrypted message in only 56 hours. Because of the inherent
              weakness of the small key size of DES, replacement algorithms were
              designed and proposed. A number of new ones appeared in the 1980s
              and 1990s. Many kept the 64 bit block size, but used a larger key
              size allowing for easier replacement of DES. In 1997, the NIST,
              National Institute of Standards and Technology wanted to replace
              DES with a new algorithm. In 2001, adopted AES, Advanced
              Encryption Standard after an international competition. AES is
              also the first and only public cipher that's approved for use with
              top secret information by the United States National Security
              Agency. AES is also a symmetric block cipher similar to DES, in
              which it replaced. But AES uses 128 bit blocks, twice the size of
              DES blocks and supports key length of 128 bit, 192 bit, or
              256-bit. Because of the large key size, brute-force attacks on AES
              are only theoretical right now because the computing power
              required or time required using modern technology exceeds anything
              feasible today. I want to call out that these algorithms are the
              overall designs of the ciphers themselves. These designs then must
              be implemented in either software or hardware before the
              encryption functions can be applied and put to use. An important
              thing to keep in mind when considering various encryption
              algorithms is speed and ease of implementation. Ideally, an
              algorithm shouldn't be overly difficult to implement because
              complicated implementation can lead to errors and potential loss
              of security due to bugs introduced in implementation. Speed is
              important because sometimes data will be encrypted by running the
              data through the cipher multiple times. These types of
              cryptographic operations wind up being performed very often by
              devices. So the faster they can be accomplished with the minimal
              impact to the system, the better. This is why some platforms
              implement these cryptographic algorithms and hardware to
              accelerate the processes and remove some of the burden from the
              CPU, for example modern CPUs from Intel or AMD have AES
              instructions built into the CPUs themselves. This allows for far
              greater computational speed and efficiency when working on
              cryptographic workloads. Let's talk briefly about what was once a
              wildly used and popular algorithm, but has since been proven to be
              weak and is discouraged from use. RC4 or Rivest Cipher 4 is a
              symmetric stream cipher that gain widespread adoption because of
              its simplicity and speed. RC4 supports key sizes from 40 bits to
              2048 bits. So the weaknesses of RC4 aren't due to brute-force
              attacks, but the cipher itself has inherent weaknesses and
              vulnerabilities that aren't only theoretically possible. There are
              lots of examples showing RC4 being broken. A recent example of RC4
              being broken is the RC4 no more attack. This attack was able to
              recover an authentication cookie from a TLS encrypted connection
              in just 52 hours. As this is an attack on the RC4 cipher itself,
              any protocol that uses this cipher is potentially vulnerable to
              the attack, even so, RC4 was used in a bunch of popular encryption
              protocols, like WEP for wireless encryption and WPA, the successor
              to WEP. It was also supported in SSL and TLS until 2015 when RC4
              was dropped in all versions of TLS because of inherent weaknesses.
              For this reason, most major web browsers have dropped support for
              RC4 entirely along with all versions of SSL and use TLS instead.
              The preferred secure configuration is TLS 1.2 with AES GCM, a
              specific mode of operation for the AES block cipher that
              essentially turns it into a stream cipher. GCM or Galois/Counter
              Mode works by taking randomized seed value, incrementing this, and
              encrypting the value, creating sequentially numbered blocks of
              ciphertext. The ciphertexts are then incorporated into the plain
              text to be encrypted.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Asymmetric Cryptography</h4>

              In this next lesson, we'll cover the second class of ciphers
              called asymmetric or public key ciphers. Remember why symmetric
              ciphers are referred to as symmetric? It's because the same key is
              used to encrypt as to decrypt. This is in contrast to asymmetric
              encryption systems because as the name implies, different keys are
              used to encrypt and decrypt. So how exactly does that work? Well,
              let's imagine here that there are two people who would like to
              communicate securely, we'll call them Suzanne and Darryl. Since
              they're using asymmetric encryption in this example, the first
              thing they each must do is generate a private key. Then, using
              this private key, a public key is derived. The strength of the
              asymmetric encryption system comes from the computational
              difficulty of figuring out the corresponding private key given a
              public key. Once Suzanne and Daryll have generated private and
              public key pairs, they exchange public keys. You might have
              guessed from the names that the public key is public and can be
              shared with anyone, while the private key must be kept secret.
              Once Suzanne and Daryll have exchanged public keys, they're ready
              to begin exchanging secure messages. When Suzanne wants to send
              Daryll an encrypted message, she uses Daryll's public key to
              encrypt the message and then send the cipher text. Darryl can then
              use his private key to decrypt the message and read it. Because of
              the relationship between private and public keys, only Daryll's
              private key can decrypt messages encrypted using Daryll's public
              key. The same is true of Suzanne's key pairs. So when Daryll is
              ready to reply to Suzanne's message, he'll use Suzanne's public
              key to encode his message, and Suzanne will use her private key to
              decrypt the message. Can you see why it's called asymmetric or
              public key cryptography? We just described encryption and
              decryption operations using an asymmetric crypto system. But
              there's one other very useful function the system can perform,
              public key signatures. Let's go back to our friends Suzanne and
              Darryl. Let's say Suzanne wants to send a message to Daryll and
              she wants to make sure that Daryll knows the message came from her
              and no one else, and that the message was not modified or tampered
              with. She could do this by composing the message and combining it
              with her private key to generate a digital signature. She then
              sends this message along with the associated digital signature to
              Daryll. We're assuming Suzanne and Daryll have already exchanged
              public keys previously in this scenario. Daryll can now verify the
              message's origin and authenticity by combining the message, the
              digital signature, and Suzanne's public key. If the message was
              actually signed using Suzanne's private key and not someone else's
              and the message wasn't modified at all, then a digital signature
              should validate. If the message was modified even by one
              whitespace character, the validation will fail and Daryll
              shouldn't trust the message. This is an important component of the
              asymmetric crypto system. Without message verification, anyone
              could use Daryll's public key and send him an encrypted message
              claiming to be from Suzanne. The three concepts that an asymmetric
              crypto system grants us are confidentiality, authenticity, and
              non-repudiation. Confidentiality is granted through the
              encryption-decryption mechanism, since our encrypted data is kept
              confidential and secret from unauthorized third parties.
              Authenticity is granted by the digital signature mechanism, as the
              message can be authenticated or verified that it wasn't tampered
              with. Non-repudiation means that the author of the message isn't
              able to dispute the origin of the message. In other words, this
              allows us to ensure that the message came from the person claiming
              to be the author.

              <h4>Symmetric Cryptography, Part Two</h4>

              Asymmetric encryption allows secure communication over an
              untrusted channel. But with symmetric encryption, we need some way
              to securely communicate the shared secret or key with the other
              party. If that's the case, it seems like asymmetric encryption is
              better. Well, while asymmetric encryption works really well in
              untrusted environments, it's also computationally more expensive
              and complex. On the other hand, symmetric encryption algorithms
              are faster and more efficient and encrypting large amounts of
              data. In fact, what many secure communication schemes do, is take
              advantage of the relative benefits of both encryption types by
              using both for different purposes. In asymmetric encryption,
              algorithm is chosen as a key exchange mechanism or cipher. What
              this means is that, the symmetric encryption key or shared secret,
              is transmitted securely to the other party using asymmetric
              encryption to keep the shared secret secure in transit. Once the
              shared secret is received, data can be sent quickly and
              efficiently and securely using an asymmetric encryption cipher.
              One last topic to mention is somewhat related to asymmetric
              encryption, and that's MACs or Message Authentication Codes. Not
              to be confused with Media Access Control or MAC addresses. A MAC
              is a bit of information that allows authentication of a received
              message, ensuring that the message came from the alleged sender
              and not a third party masquerading as them. It also ensures that
              the message wasn't modified in some way in order to provide data
              integrity. This sounds super similar to digital signatures using
              public key cryptography, doesn't it? While very similar, it
              differs slightly since the secret key that's used to generate the
              MAC, is the same one that's used to verify it. In this sense, it's
              similar to symmetric encryption system and the secret key must be
              agreed upon by all communicating parties beforehand or shared in
              some secure way. This describes one popular in secure type of MAC
              called HMAC, or a keyed hash message authentication code. HMAC
              uses a cryptographic hash function along with a secret key to
              generate a MAC. Any cryptographic hash functions can be used like
              SHA-1 or MD5. The strength or security of the MAC, is dependent
              upon the underlying security of the cryptographic hash function
              used. The MAC is sent alongside the message that's being checked.
              The MAC is verified by the receiver by performing the same
              operation on the received message, then comparing the computed MAC
              with the one received with the message. If the MACs are the same,
              then the message is authenticated. There are also MACs based on
              symmetric encryption ciphers, either block or stream, like DES or
              AES, which are called CMACs or Cipher- Based Message
              Authentication Codes. The process is similar to HMAC, but instead
              of using a hashing function to produce a digest, a symmetric
              cipher with a shared key is used to encrypt the message and the
              resulting output is used as the MAC. A specific and popular
              example of a CMAC, though slightly different, is CBC-MAC or cipher
              block chaining message authentication codes. CBC-MAC is a
              mechanism for building MACs using block ciphers. This works by
              taking a message and encrypting it using a block cipher operating
              in CBC mode. CBC mode is an operating mode for block ciphers that
              incorporates the previously encrypted blocks ciphertext into the
              next blocks of plain texts so it builds a chain of encrypted
              blocks that require the full unmodified and chain to decrypt. This
              chain of interdependently encrypted blocks means that any
              modification to the plaintext, will result in a different final
              output at the end of the chain, ensuring message integrity.

              <h4>Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms</h4>
              So one of the first practical asymmetric cryptography systems to
              be developed is RSA. Named for the initials of the three
              co-inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Alderman. This
              crypto system was patented in 1983 and was released to the public
              domain by RSA security in the year 2000. The RSA system specifies
              mechanisms for generation and distribution of keys, along with
              encryption and decryption operation using these keys. We won't go
              into the details of the math involved, since it's pretty high
              level stuff and beyond the scope of this class. But, it's
              important to know that the key generation process depends on
              choosing two unique, random and usually very large prime numbers.
              DSA, or digital signature algorithm, is another example of an
              asymmetric encryption system, though it's used for signing and
              verifying data. It was patented in 1991 and is part of the US
              government's federal information processing standard. Similar to
              RSA, the specification covers the key generation process, along
              with the signing and verifying data using the key pairs. It's
              important to call out that the security of the system is dependent
              on choosing a random seed value that's incorporated into the
              signing process. If this value is leaked or if it can be inferred,
              if the prime number isn't truly random, then it's possible for an
              attacker to recover the private key. This actually happened in
              2010 to Sony with their PlayStation 3 Game Console. It turns out
              they weren't ensuring this randomized value was changed for every
              signature. This resulted in a hacker group called Fail0verflow
              being able to recover the private key that Sony used to sign
              software for their platform. This allowed matters to write and
              sign custom software that was allowed to run on the otherwise very
              lockdown Console platform. This resulted in game piracy becoming a
              problem for Sony as this facilitated the illicit copying and
              distribution of games which caused significant losses in sales.
              Earlier, we talked about how asymmetric systems are commonly used
              as key exchange mechanisms to establish a shared secret that will
              be used with symmetric cipher. Another popular key exchange
              algorithm is DH or Diffie-Hellman named for the co-inventors.
              Let's walk through how the DH key exchange algorithm works. Let's
              assume we have two people who would like to communicate over an
              unsecured channel. And let's call them Suzanne and Daryll. I've
              grown pretty fond of these two. First, Suzanne and Darryl agree on
              the starting number, that would be random and will be a very large
              integer. This number should be different for every session and
              doesn't need to be secret. Next, each person chooses another
              randomized large number, but this one is kept secret. Then, they
              combine their shared number with their respective secret number
              and send the resulting mixed to each other. Next, each person
              combines their secret number with the combined value they received
              from the previous step. The result is a new value that's the same
              on both sides without disclosing enough information to any
              potential eavesdroppers to figure out the shared secret. This
              algorithm was designed solely for key exchange, though there have
              been efforts to adapt it for encryption purposes. It's even been
              used as part of a PKI system or Public Key Infrastructure system.
              Elliptic curve cryptography, or ECC, is a public-key encryption
              system that uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over
              finite fields to generate secure keys. What does that even mean?
              Well, traditional public key systems make use of factoring large
              prime numbers, whereas ECC makes use of elliptic curves. An
              elliptic curve is composed of a set of coordinates that fit an
              equation similar to something like y to the second = x to the
              third plus ax + b. Elliptic curves have a couple of interesting
              and unique properties. One is horizontal symmetry, which means
              that at any point in the curve can be mirrored along the x-axis
              and still make up the same curve. On top of this, any non-vertical
              line will intersect the curve in three places at most. It's this
              last property that allows elliptic curves to be used in
              encryption. The benefit of elliptic curve based encryption systems
              is that they're able to achieve security similar to traditional
              public key systems with smaller key sizes. So, for example, a 256
              bit elliptic curve key would be comparable to a 3072 bit RSA key.
              This is really beneficial, since it reduces the amount of data
              needed to be stored and transmitted when dealing with keys. Both
              Diffie-Hellman and DSA have elliptic curve variants, referred to
              as ECDH and ECDSA, respectively. The US NIST recommends the use of
              EC encryption, and the NSA allows its use to protect up to top
              secret data with 384 bit EC keys. But, the NSA has expressed
              concern about EC encryption being potentially vulnerable to
              quantum computing attacks, as quantum computing technology
              continues to evolve and mature.

              <h4>Hashing</h4>

              So far, we've talked about two forms of encryption, symmetric and
              asymmetric. In this next lesson, we're going to cover a special
              type of function that's widely used in computing and especially
              within security hashing. No, not the breakfast kind, although
              those are delicious. Hashing or a hash function is a type of
              function or operation that takes in an arbitrary data input and
              maps it to an output of a fixed size called a hash or a digest.
              The output size is usually specified in bits of data and is often
              included in the hashing function name. What this means exactly is
              that you feed in any amount of data into a hash function and the
              resulting output will always be the same size, but the output
              should be unique to the input, such that two different inputs
              should never yield the same output. Hash functions have a large
              number of applications in computing in general, typically used to
              uniquely identify data. You may have heard the term hash table
              before in the context of software engineering. This is a type of
              data structure that uses hashes to accelerate data lookups.
              Hashing can also be used to identify duplicate datasets and
              databases or archives to speed up searching of tables or to remove
              duplicate data to save space. Depending on the application, there
              are various properties that may be desired and a variety of
              hashing functions exist for various applications. We're primarily
              concerned with cryptographic hash functions, which are used for
              various applications like authentication, message integrity,
              fingerprinting, data corruption detection, and digital signatures.
              Cryptographic hashing is distinctly different from encryption
              because cryptographic hash functions should be one-directional.
              They're similar in that you can input plain texts into the hash
              function and get output that's unintelligible, but you can't take
              the hash output and recover the plaintext. The ideal cryptographic
              hash function should be deterministic, meaning that the same input
              value should always return the same hash value. The function
              should be quick to compute and be efficient, it should be
              infeasible to reverse the function and recover the plain text from
              the hash digest. A small change in the input should result in a
              change in the output so that there is no correlation between the
              change in the input and the resulting change in the output.
              Finally, the function should not allow for hash collisions,
              meaning two different inputs mapping to the same output.
              Cryptographic hash functions are very similar to symmetric key
              block ciphers in that they operate on blocks of data. In fact,
              many popular hash functions are actually based on modified block
              ciphers. Let's take a basic example to quickly demonstrate how a
              hash function works. We'll use an imaginary hash function for
              demonstration purposes. Let's say we have an input string of
              "Hello World", and we feed this into a hash function which
              generates the resulting hash of E49AOOFF. Every time we feed this
              string into our function, we get the same hash digest output. Now
              let's modify the input very slightly, so it becomes "hello world",
              all lowercase now, while this change seems small to us, the
              resulting hash output is wildly different FF1832AE. Here's the
              same example, but using a real hash function, in this case,
              md5sum.

              Hopefully, the concept of hash functions make sense to you now.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Hashing Algorithms</h4>
              In this section, we'll cover some of the more popular hashing
              functions, both currently and historically. MD5 is a popular and
              widely used hash function designed in the early 1990s as a
              cryptographic hashing function. It operates on a 512 bit blocks
              and generates 128 bit hash digest. While MD5 was published in
              1992, a design flaw was discovered in 1996, and cryptographers
              recommended using the SHA1 hash, a more secure alternative. But,
              this flow was not deemed critical so the hash function continued
              to see widespread use and adoption. In 2004, it was discovered
              that MD5 is susceptible to hash collisions, allowing for a bad
              actor to craft a malicious file that can generate the same MD5
              digest as another different legitimate file. Bad actors are the
              worst, aren't they? Shortly after this flaw was discovered,
              security researchers were able to generate two different files
              that have matching MD5 hash digest. In 2008, security researchers
              took this a step further and demonstrated the ability to create a
              fake SSL certificate that validated due to an MD5 hash collision.
              Due to these very serious vulnerabilities in the hash function, it
              was recommended to stop using MD5 for cryptographic applications
              by 2010. In 2012, this hash collision was used for nefarious
              purposes in the Flame malware, which used the forage Microsoft
              digital certificate to sign their malware, which resulted in the
              malware appearing to be from legitimate software that came from
              Microsoft. When design flaws were discovered in MD5, it was
              recommended to use SHA1 as a replacement. SHA1 is part of the
              Secure Hash Algorithm suite of functions designed by the NSA and
              published in 1995. It operates a 512 bit blocks and generates 160
              bit hash digest. SHA1 is another widely used cryptographic hashing
              functions used in popular protocols like TLS/SSL, PGP/SSH, and
              IPSec. SHA1 is also used in version control systems like Git,
              which uses hashes to identify revisions and ensure data integrity
              by detecting corruption or tampering. SHA1 and SHA2 were required
              for use in some US government cases for protection of sensitive
              information, although the US National Institute of Standards and
              Technology recommend stopping the use of SHA1 and relying on SHA2
              in 2010. Many other organizations have also recommended replacing
              SHA1 with SHA2, or SHA3. SHA1 also has its share of weaknesses and
              vulnerabilities with security researchers trying to demonstrate
              realistic hash collisions. During the 2000s, a bunch of
              theoretical attacks were formulated and some partial collisions
              were demonstrated. But full collisions using these methods
              requires significant computing power. One such attack was
              estimated to require $2.77 million in Cloud computing CPU
              resources Wausau. In 2015, a different attack method was developed
              that didn't demonstrate a full collision. But this was the first
              time that one of these attacks was demonstrated, which had major
              implications for the future security of SHA1. What was only
              theoretically possible before was now becoming possible with more
              efficient attack methods and increases in computing performance,
              especially in the space of GPU accelerated computations and Cloud
              resources. A full collision with this attack method was estimated
              to be feasible using CPU and GPU Cloud computing for approximately
              75 to $120,000, much cheaper than previous attacks. In early 2017,
              the first full collision of SHA1 was published. Using significant
              CPU and GPU resources, two unique PDF files were created that
              result in the same SHA1 hash. The estimated processing power
              required to do this was described as equivalent of 6,500 years of
              a single CPU and 110 years of a single GPU computing non-stop.
              That's a lot of years. There's also the concept of a MIC, or
              message integrity check. This shouldn't be confused with a MAC, or
              message authentication check, since how they work in what they
              protect against is different. A MIC is essentially a hash digest
              of the message in question. You can think of it as a checksum for
              the message, ensuring that the contents of the message weren't
              modified in transit. But this is distinctly different from a MAC
              that we talked about earlier. It doesn't use secret keys, which
              means the message isn't authenticated. There's nothing stopping an
              attacker from altering the message, recomputing the checksum, and
              modifying the MIC attached to the message. You can think of MICs
              as protecting against accidental corruption or loss, but not
              protecting against tampering or malicious actions.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Hashing Algorithms</h4>
              We've already alluded to attacks on hashes. Now let's learn some
              more details including how to defend against these attacks. One
              crucial application for cryptographic hash functions is for
              authentication. Think about when you log into your email account,
              you enter your email address and password. What do you think
              happens in the background for the email system to authenticate
              you? It has to verify that the password you entered is the correct
              one for your account. You could just take the user-supplied
              password and look up the password on file for the given account
              and compare them, right? If they're the same, then the user is
              authenticated. Seems like a simple solution. But does that seem
              secure to you? In the authentication scenario, we'd have to store
              user passwords in plain text somewhere. That's a terrible idea.
              You should never ever store sensitive information like passwords
              in plain text. Instead, you should do what pretty much every
              authentication system does, store a hash of the password instead
              of the password itself. When you log into your email account, the
              password you entered is run through the hashing function and then
              the resulting hash digest is compared against the hash on file. If
              the hashes match, then we know the password is correct and you're
              authenticated. Password shouldn't be stored in plain text because
              if your systems are compromised, passwords for other accounts are
              ultimate prize for the attacker. If an attacker manages to gain
              access to your system and can just copy the database of accounts
              and passwords, this would obviously be a bad situation. By only
              storing password hashes, the worst the attacker would be able to
              recover would be password hashes, which aren't really useful on
              their own. What if the attacker wanted to figure out what
              passwords correspond to the hashes they stole. They would perform
              a brute force attack against the password hash database. This is
              where the attacker just tries all possible input values until a
              resulting hash matches the one they're trying to recover the
              plaintext from. Once there's a match, we know that the input
              that's generated that matches the hash is the corresponding
              password. As you can imagine, a brute force attack can be very
              computationally intensive depending on the hashing function used.
              An important characteristic to call out about brute force attacks
              is, technically, they're impossible to protect against completely.
              A successful brute force attack, against even the most secure
              system imaginable, is a function of attacker time and resources.
              If an attacker has unlimited time and or resources, any system can
              be brute forced. Yikes. So, the best we can do to protect against
              these attacks is to raise the bar, make it sufficiently time and
              resource intensive so that it's not practically feasible in a
              useful time frame or with existing technology. Another common
              method to help raise the computational bar and protect against
              brute force attacks, is to run the password through the hashing
              function multiple times. Sometimes, through thousands of
              iterations. This would require significantly more computations for
              each password guess attempt. That brings us to the topic of
              rainbow tables. Don't be fooled by the colorful name. These tables
              are used by bad actors to help speed up the process of recovering
              passwords from stolen password hashes. A rainbow table is just a
              pre computed table of all possible password values, and their
              corresponding hashes. The idea behind rainbow table attacks is to
              trade computational power for disk space, by pre computing the
              hashes and storing them in a table. An attacker can determine what
              the corresponding password is for a given hash, by just looking up
              the hash in their rainbow table. This is unlike a brute force
              attack, where the hash is computed for each guess attempt. It's
              possible to download rainbow tables from the internet for popular
              password lists and hashing functions. This further reduces the
              need for computational resources, requiring large amounts of
              storage space to keep all the password and hash data. So, you may
              be wondering how you can protect against these pre computed
              rainbow tables. That's where salts come into play. And no, I'm not
              talking about table salt. A password salt is additional randomized
              data that's added into the hashing function to generate a hash
              that's unique to the password and salt combination. Here's how it
              works. A randomly chosen large salt is concatenated or attacked
              onto the end of the password. The combination of salt and password
              is then run through the hashing function to generate the hash,
              which is then stored alongside the salt.
              <img src="image/5/password.jpeg" alt="" />
              What this means now for an attacker, is that they'd have to
              compute a rainbow table for each possible salt value. If a large
              salt is used, the computational and storage requirements to
              generate useful rainbow tables becomes almost infeasible. Early
              UNIX systems used a 12 bit salt, which amounts to a total of 4096
              possible salts. So an attacker would have to generate hashes for
              every password in their database 4096 times over. Modern systems
              like Linux, BSD and Solaris use a 128 bit salt. That means, there
              are 2 to the 128th power possible salt values, which is over 340
              undecillion, that's 340 with 36 zeros following. Clearly, 128 bit
              salt raises the bar high enough that a rainbow table attack
              wouldn't be possible in any realistic timeframe. Just another
              scenario when adding salt to something makes it even better. Well,
              that runs out our lesson on hashing functions

              <h4>Public Key Infrastructure</h4>

              In this lesson, we're going to cover PKI or Public Key
              Infrastructure. Spoiler alert, this is a critical piece to
              securing communications on the Internet today. Earlier, we talked
              about public key cryptography and how it can be used to securely
              transmit data over an untrusted channel and verify the identity of
              a sender using digital signatures. PKI is a system that defines
              the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates. A
              digital certificate is a file that proves that an entity owns a
              certain public key. A certificate contains information about the
              public key, the entity it belongs to, and a digital signature from
              another party that has verified this information. If the signature
              is valid and we trust the entity that signed the certificate, then
              we can trust the public key to be used to securely communicate
              with the entity that owns it. The entity that is responsible for
              storing, issuing, and signing certificates is referred to as CA,
              or Certificate Authority. It's a crucial component of a PKI
              system. There's also an RA or Registration Authority that's
              responsible for verifying the identities of any entities
              requesting certificates to be signed and stored with the CA. This
              role is usually lumped together with the CA. A central repository
              is needed to securely store and index keys, and a certificate
              management system of some sort, makes managing access to storage
              certificates and issuance of certificates easier. There were a few
              different types of certificates that have different applications
              or uses. The one you're probably most familiar with is SSL or TLS
              server certificate. This is a certificate that a web server
              presents to a client as part of the initial secure setup of an
              SSL/TLS connection. The client, usually a web browser, will then
              verify that the subject of the certificate matches the host name
              of the server the client is trying to connect to. The client will
              also verify that the certificate is signed by a certificate
              authority that the client trusts. It's possible for a certificate
              to be valid for multiple host names. In some cases, a wildcard
              certificate can be issued where the host name is replaced with an
              asterix denoting validity for all host names within a domain. It's
              also possible for a server to use what's called a self-signed
              certificate. You may have guessed from the name, this certificate
              has been signed by the same entity that issued the certificate.
              This would basically be signing your own public key using your
              private key. Unless you already trusted this key, this certificate
              would fail to verify. Another certificate type is an SSL/TLS
              client certificate. This is an optional component of SSL/TLS
              connections and is less commonly seen than server certificates. As
              the name implies, these are certificates that are bound to clients
              and are used to authenticate the client to the server, allowing
              access control to an SSL/TLS service. These are different from
              server certificates, in that the client certificates aren't issued
              by a public CA. Usually, the service operator would have their own
              internal CA which issues and manages client certificates for their
              service. There are also code signing certificates which are used
              for signing executable programs. This allows users of the signed
              applications to verify the signatures and ensure that the
              application was not tampered with. It also lets them verify that
              the application came from the software author and is not a
              malicious twin. We've mentioned certificate authority trust, but
              not really explained it, so let's take some time to go over how it
              all works. PKI is very much dependent on trust relationships
              between entities and building a network or chain of trust. This
              chain of trust has to start somewhere, and that starts with the
              root certificate authority. These root certificates are
              self-signed because they are the start of the chain of trust, so
              there's no higher authority that can sign on their behalf. This
              root certificate authority can now use the self-signed certificate
              and the associated private key to begin signing other public keys
              and issuing certificates. It builds a tree structure with the root
              private key at the top of the structure. If the root CA signs a
              certificate and sets a field in the certificate called CA to true,
              this marks a certificate as an intermediary or subordinate CA.
              What this means is that the entity that this certificate was
              issued to can now sign other certificates, and this CA has the
              same trust as the root CA. An intermediary CA can also assign
              other intermediate CAs. You can see how this extension of trust
              from one root CA to intermediaries can begin to build a chain. A
              certificate that has no authority as a CA is referred to as an
              end-entity or leaf certificate. Similar to a leaf on a tree, it's
              the end of the tree structure and can be considered the opposite
              of the roots. You might be wondering how these root CAs wind-up
              being trusted in the first place? Well, that's a very good
              question. In order to bootstrap this chain of trust, you have to
              trust a root CA certificate, otherwise, the whole chain is
              untrusted. This is done by distributing root CA certificates via
              alternative channels. Each major OS vendor ships a large number of
              trusted root CA certificates with their OS. They typically have
              their own programs to facilitate distribution of root CA
              certificates. Most browsers will then utilize the OS provided
              store of root certificates. Required en ​

              <h4>Certificates</h4>

              Let's do a deep dive into certificates beyond just their function.
              The X.509 standard is what defines the format of digital
              certificates. It also defines a certificate revocation list, or
              CRL, which is a means to distribute a list of certificates that
              are no longer valid. The X.509 standard was first issued in 1988.
              The current modern version of the standard is Version 3. The
              fields defined in an X.509 certificate are; the version, what
              version of the X.509 standard the certificate adheres to. Serial
              number, a unique identifier for the certificate assigned by the
              CA, which allows the CA to manage and identify individual
              certificates. Certificates signature algorithm. This field
              indicates what public key algorithm is used for the public key and
              what hashing algorithm is used to sign the certificate. Issuer
              name. This field contains information about the authority that
              sign the certificate. Validity. This contains two subfields, Not
              Before and Not After, which define the dates when the certificate
              is valid for. Subject. This field contains identifying information
              about the entity the certificate was issued to. Subject public key
              info. These two subfields define the algorithm of the public key
              along with the public key itself. Certificates signature
              algorithm, same as the subject public key and field, these two
              fields must match. Certificate signature value, the digital
              signature data itself. There are also certificate fingerprints
              which aren't actually fields in the certificate itself, but are
              computed by clients when validated or inspecting certificates.
              These are just hash digest of the whole certificate. Alternative
              to the centralized PKI model of establishing trust and binding
              identities is what's called the web of trust. A web of trust is
              where individuals, instead of certificate authorities, sign other
              individuals public keys. Before an individual signs a key, they
              should first verify the person's identity through an agreed upon
              mechanism, usually by checking some form of identification,
              driver's license, passport, etc. Once they've determined the
              person is who they claim to be, signing their public key is
              basically vouching for this person. You're saying that you trust
              that this public key belongs to this individual. This process
              would be reciprocal, meaning both parties would sign each other's
              keys. Usually people who are interested in establishing web of
              trust will organize what are called key signing parties, where
              participants perform the same verification and signing. At the end
              of the party, everyone's public keys should have been signed by
              every other participant, establishing a web of trust. In the
              future when one of these participants in the initial key signing
              party establishes trust with a new member. The web of trust
              extends to include this new member and other individuals they also
              trust. This allows separate webs of trust to be bridged by
              individuals and allows the network of trust to grow.

              <h4>Cryptography in Action</h4>

              In this section, we'll dive into some real world applications of
              the encryption concepts that we've covered so far. In the last
              section we mentioned SSL/TLS when we were talking about digital
              certificates. Now that we understand how digital certificates
              function and the crucial roles CAs play, let's check out how that
              fits into securing web traffic via HTTPS. You've probably heard of
              HTTPS before, but do you know exactly what it is and how it's
              different from HTTP? Very simply, HTTPS is the secure version of
              HTTP, the hypertext transport protocol. So how exactly does HTTPS
              protect us on the Internet? HTTPS can also be called HTTP over SSL
              or TLS since it's essentially encapsulating the HTTP traffic over
              an encrypted secured channel utilizing SSL or TLS. You might hear
              SSL and TLS used interchangeably, but SSL 3.0, the latest revision
              of SSL, was deprecating in 2015. Now, it's important to call out
              that TLS is actually independent of HTTPS, and is actually a
              generic protocol to permit secure communications and
              authentication over a network. TLS is also used to secure other
              communications aside from web browsing like VoIP calls, such as
              Skype or Hangouts, email, instant messaging, and even wifi network
              security. TLS grants us three things. One, a secure communication
              line, which means data being transmitted is protected from
              potential eavesdroppers. Two, the ability to authenticate both
              parties communicating, through typically only the server is
              authenticated by the client. And three, the integrity of
              communications, meaning there are checks to ensure that messages
              aren't lost or altered in transit. TLS essentially provides a
              secure channel for an application to communicate with the service.
              But there must be a mechanism to establish this channel initially.
              This is what's referred to as a TLS handshake. I'm more of a high
              five person myself, but we can move on. The handshake process
              kicks off with a client establishing a connection with a TLS
              enabled service referred to in the protocol as ClientHello. This
              includes information about the client, like the version of the TLS
              that the client supports, a list of cipher suites that it
              supports, and maybe some additional TLS options. The server then
              responds with a ServerHello message in which it selects the
              highest protocol version in common with the client and chooses a
              cipher suite from the list to use. It also transmits its digital
              certificate and a final ServerHelloDone message. The client would
              then validate the certificate that the server sent over to ensure
              that it's trusted and it's for the appropriate host name. Assuming
              the certificate checks out, the client then sends a
              ClientKeyExchange message. This is when the client chooses a key
              exchange mechanism to securely establish a shared secret with the
              server which will be used with a symmetric encryption cipher to
              encrypt all further communications. The client also sends a
              ChangeCipherSpec message indicating that it's switching to secure
              communications now that it has all the information needed to begin
              communicating over the secure channel.
              <img src="image/5/cryptography.jpeg" alt="" />
              This is followed by an encrypted Finished message which also
              serves to verify that the handshake completed successfully. The
              server replies with a ChangeCpherSpec and an encrypted Finished
              message, once the shared secret is received. Once complete,
              application data can begin to flow over the now secured channel,
              high five to that. The session key is the shared symmetric
              encryption key used in TLS sessions to encrypt data being sent
              back and forth. Since this key is derived from the public private
              key, if the private key is compromised, there's potential for an
              attacker to decode all previously transmitted messages that were
              encoded using keys derived from this private key. To defend
              against this, there's a concept of forward secrecy. This is a
              property of a cryptographic system so that even in the event that
              the private key is compromised, the session keys are still safe.
              The SSH or Secure Shell is a secure network protocol that uses
              encryption to allow access to a network service over unsecured
              networks. Most commonly you'll see SSH used for remote login to
              command line based systems. But the protocol is super flexible and
              has provisions for allowing arbitrary network ports and traffic
              over those ports to be tunneled over the encrypted channel. It was
              originally designed as a secure replacement for the telnet
              protocol and other unsecured remote login Shell protocols like
              rlogin or rexec. It's very important that remote login and Shell
              protocols use encryption. Otherwise, these services will be
              transmitting user names and passwords along with keystrokes and
              terminal output in plain text. This opens up the possibility for
              an eavesdropper to intercept credentials and keystrokes, not good.
              SSH uses public key cryptography to authenticate the remote
              machine that the client is connecting to and has provisions to
              allow user authentication via client certificates if desired. The
              SSH protocol is very flexible and modular and supports a wide
              variety of different key exchange mechanisms like Diffie-Hellman,
              along with a variety of symmetric encryption ciphers. It also
              supports a variety of authentication methods, including custom
              ones that you can write. When using public key authentication, a
              key pier is generated by the user who wants to authenticate. They
              then must distribute those public keys to all systems that they
              want to authenticate to using the key pair. When authenticating,
              SSH will ensure that the public key being presented matches the
              private key which should never leave the user's possession. PGP
              stands for pretty good privacy. How's that for a creative name?
              PGP is an encryption application that allows authentication of
              data, along with privacy from third parties, relying upon
              asymmetric encryption to achieve this. It's most commonly used for
              encrypted email communication, but it's also available as a full
              disk encryption solution or for encrypting arbitrary files,
              documents or folders. PGP was developed by Phil Zimmermann in
              1991, and it was freely available for anyone to use. The source
              code was even distributed along with the software. Zimmermann was
              an anti-nuclear activist and political activism drove his
              development of the PGP encryption software to facilitate secure
              communications for other activists. PGP took off once released and
              found its way around the world, which wound up getting Zimmermann
              into hot water with the US federal government. At the time, US
              federal export regulations classified encryption technology that
              used keys larger than 40 bits in length as munitions. This meant
              that PGP was subject to similar restrictions as rockets, bombs,
              firearms, even nuclear weapons. PGP was designed to use keys no
              smaller than 128 bit. So it ran up against these export
              restrictions. And Zimmermann faced a federal investigation for the
              widespread distribution of his cryptographic software. Zimmermann
              took a creative approach to challenging these restrictions by
              publishing the source code in a hardcover printed book which was
              made available widely. The idea was that the contents of the book
              should be protected by the first Amendment of the US constitution.
              Pretty clever? The investigation was eventually closed in 1996
              without any charges being filed, and Zimmermann didn't even need
              to go to court. PGP is widely regarded as very secure, with no
              known mechanisms to break the encryption via cryptographic or
              computational means. It's been compared to military grade
              encryption and there are numerous cases of police and governments
              unable to recover data protected by PGP encryption. In these
              cases, law enforcement tend to resort to legal measure to force
              the handover of passwords or keys. Originally PGP used the RSA
              algorithm, though that was eventually replaced with DSA to avoid
              issues with licensing.

              <h4>Securing Network Traffic</h4>

              Let's talk about securing network traffic. As we've seen,
              encryption is used for protecting data both from the privacy
              perspective and the data integrity perspective. A natural
              application of this technology is to protect data intransit. But
              what if our application doesn't utilize encryption or what if we
              want to provide remote access to internal resources too sensitive
              to expose directly to the internet? We use a VPN or virtual
              private network solution. A VPN is a mechanism that allows you to
              remotely connect a host or network to an internal private network,
              passing the data over a public channel like the internet. You can
              think of this as a sort of encrypted tunnel where all of our
              remote systems network traffic would flow, transparently
              channeling our packets via the tunnel through the remote private
              network. A VPN can also be point to point where two gateways are
              connected via a VPN, essentially bridging two private networks
              through an encrypted tunnel.
              <img src="image/5/vpn.jpeg" alt="" />
              There are a bunch of VPN solutions using different approaches and
              protocols with differing benefits and tradeoffs. Let's go over
              some of the more popular ones. IPsec or internet protocol
              security, is a VPN protocol that was designed in conjunction with
              IPV6. It was originally required to be standards compliant with
              IPV6 implementations, but was eventually dropped as a requirement,
              it is optional for use with IPV6. IPsec works by encrypting an IP
              packet and encapsulating the encrypted packet inside an IPsec
              packet. This encrypted packet then gets routed to the VPN
              end-point where the packet is de-encapsulated and decrypted then
              sent to the final destination.
              <img src="image/5/ip-packet.jpeg" alt="" />
              IPsec supports two modes of operations, transport mode and tunnel
              mode. When transport mode is used, only the payload of the IP
              packet is encrypted, leaving the IP headers untouched. Heads up
              that authentication headers are also used, header values are
              hashed and verified along with the transport and application
              layers. This would prevent the use of anything that would modify
              these values like NAT or PET. In tunnel mode, the entire IP
              packet, header payload and all, is encrypted and encapsulated
              inside a new IP packet with new headers. While not a VPN solution
              itself, L2TP or layer two tunneling protocol is typically used to
              support VPNs. A common implementation of L2TP is in conjunction
              with IPsec when data confidentiality is needed. Since L2TP doesn't
              provide encryption itself, it's a simple tunneling protocol that
              allows encapsulation of different protocols or traffic over a
              network that may not support the type of traffic being sent. L2TP
              can also just segregate and manage the traffic. ISPs will use L2TP
              to deliver network access to a customer's end point. For example,
              the combination of L2TP and IPsec is referred to as L2TP IPsec and
              was officially standardized in IETF RFC 3193. The establishment of
              an L2TP IPsec connection works by first negotiating an IPsec
              security association which negotiates the details of the secure
              connection including key exchange if used. It can also share
              secrets, public keys and a number of other mechanisms. Next,
              secure communication is established using encapsulating security
              payload. It's a part of the IPsec suite of protocols which
              encapsulates IP packets providing confidentiality, integrity and
              authentication of the packets. Once secure encapsulation has been
              established, negotiation and establishment of the L2TP tunnel can
              proceed. L2TP packets are now encapsulated by IPsec protecting
              information about the private intern network. An important
              distinction to make in this setup is the difference between the
              tunnel and the secure channel. The tunnel is provided by L2TP
              which permits the passing of unmodified packets from one network
              to another. The secure channel, on the other hand, is provided by
              IPsec which provides confidentiality, integrity and authentication
              of data being passed. SSL, TLS is also used in some VPN
              implementations to secure network traffic as opposed to individual
              sessions or connections. An example of this is OpenVPN which uses
              the open SSL library to handle key exchange and encryption of data
              along with control channels. This also enables OpenVPN to make use
              of all the ciphers implemented by the open SSL library.
              Authentication methods supported our pre-shared secrets,
              certificate-based and user name password. Certificate-based
              authentication would be the most secure option, but it requires
              more support and management overhead since every client must have
              a certificate. User name password authentication can be used in
              conjunction with certificate authentication, providing additional
              layers of security. It should be called out that OpenVPN doesn't
              implement user name password authentication directly, it uses
              modules to plug into authentication systems. OpenVPN can operate
              over either TCP or UDP, typically over ports 1194. It supports
              pushing network configuration options from the server to a client
              and it supports two interfaces for networking. It can either rely
              on a layer 3 IP tunnel or a layer 2 ethernet tap. The ethernet tap
              is more flexible, allowing it to carry a wider range of traffic.
              From the security perspective, OpenVPN supports up to 256 bit
              encryption through the OpenSSL library. It also runs in user space
              limiting the seriousness of potential vulnerabilities that might
              be present. Required en ​

              <h4>Cryptographic Hardware</h4>

              Welcome back. Let's dive right in. Another interesting application
              of cryptography concepts is the trusted platform module or TPM.
              This is a hardware device that's typically integrated into the
              hardware of a computer that's a dedicated crypto processor.
              <img src="image/5/tpm.jpeg" alt="" />
              TPMs offer secure generation of keys, random number generation,
              remote attestation, and data binding and seiling. A TPM has unique
              secret RSA key burned into the hardware at the time of
              manufacturer, which allows the TPM to perform things like hardware
              authentication. This can detect unauthorized hardware changes to a
              system. Remote attestation is the idea of a system authenticating
              its software and hardware configuration to a remote system. This
              enables the remote system to determine the integrity of the remote
              system. This can be done using a TPM by generating a secure hash
              of the system configuration using the unique RSA key embedded in
              the TPM itself. Another use of the secret hardware backed
              encryption key is data binding and sealing, it involves using the
              secret key to derive a unique key that's then used for encryption
              of data. Basically, this binds the encrypted data to the TPM and
              by extension the system the TPM is installed in, since only the
              key stored in hardware in the TPM will be able to decrypt the
              data. Data sealing is similar to binding since data is encrypted
              using the hardware backed encryption key. But, in order for the
              data to be decrypted, the TPM must be in a specified state. TPM is
              a standard with several revisions that can be implemented as a
              discrete hardware chip, integrated into another chip in the
              system, implemented in firmware software or virtualized in a hyper
              visor. The most secure implementation is the discrete chip since
              these chip packages also incorporate physical tamper resistance to
              prevent physical attacks on the chip. Mobile devices have
              something similar referred to as a secure element similar to a
              TPM. It's a tamper resistant chip often embedded in the
              microprocessor or integrated into the main board of a mobile
              device. It supplies secure storage of cryptographic keys and
              provides a secure environment for applications. An evolution of
              secure elements is the trusted execution environment or TEE, which
              takes the concept a bit further. It provides a full-blown isolated
              execution environment that runs alongside the main OS. This
              provides isolation of the applications from the main OS and other
              applications installed there. It also isolates secure processes
              from each other when running in the TEE. TPMs have received
              criticism around trusting the manufacturer. Since the secret key
              is burned into the hardware at the time of manufacturer, the
              manufacturer would have access to this key at the time. It is
              possible for the manufacturer to store the keys that could then be
              used to duplicate a TPM that could break the security the module
              is supposed to provide. There's been one report of a physical
              attack on a TPM which allowed a security researcher to view and
              access the entire contents of a TPM. But this attack required the
              use of an electron microscope and micron precision equipment for
              manipulating the TPM circuitry. While the process was incredibly
              time intensive and required highly specialized equipment, it
              proved that such an attack is possible, despite the tamper
              protections in place. TPMs are most commonly used to ensure
              platform integrity, preventing unauthorized changes to the system
              either in software hardware and full disk encryption, utilizing
              the TPM to protect the entire contents of the disc. Full disk
              encryption or FDE as you might have guessed from the name is the
              practice of encrypting the entire drive of the system, not just
              sensitive files in the system. This allows us to protect the
              entire contents of the disc from data theft or tampering. Now,
              there are a bunch of options for implementing FDE. Like the
              commercial product, PGP, Bitlocker from Microsoft, which
              integrates very well with TPM. Filevault 2 from Apple and the open
              source software, dm-crypt, which provides encryption for Linux
              systems. An FDE D configuration will have one partition or logical
              partition that holds the data to be encrypted, typically, the root
              volume, where the OS is installed. But, in order for the volume to
              be booted, it must first be unlocked at boot time. Because the
              volume is encrypted, the BIOS can't access data on this volume for
              boot purposes. This is why FDE configurations will have a small
              unencrypted boot partition that contains elements like the kernel,
              bootloader and a NRD. At boot time, these elements are loaded
              which then prompts the user to enter a pass phrase to unlock the
              disk and continue the boot process.
              <img src="image/5/boot-process.jpeg" alt="" />
              FDE can also incorporate the TPM, utilizing the TPM encryption
              keys to protect the disk. And, it has platform integrity to
              prevent unlocking of the disk if the system configuration has
              changed. This protects against attacks like hardware tampering and
              disk theft or cloning. Before we wrap up this module on
              encryption, I wanted to touch base on the concept of random.
              Earlier, when we covered the various encryption systems, one
              commonality kept coming up that these systems rely on. Did you
              notice what it was? That's okay if you didn't. It's the selection
              of random numbers. This is a very important concept in encryption.
              Because if your number selection process isn't truly random, then
              there can be some kind of pattern that an adversary could discover
              through close observation and analysis of encrypted messages over
              time. Something that isn't truly random is referred to as
              pseudorandom. It's for this reason that operating systems maintain
              what's referred to as an entropy pool. This is essentially a
              source of random data to help seed random number generators.
              There's also dedicated random number generators and pseudorandom
              number generators, that can be incorporated into a security
              appliance or server. To ensure that truly random numbers are
              chosen when generating cryptographic keys. So, I hope you found
              these topics in cryptography interesting and informative. I know I
              did when I first learned about them.

              <h4>Best practices for authentication</h4>
              In this module, we'll cover the three A's of security, which are
              authentication, authorization, and accounting. We'll cover exactly
              what they are, how they relate to each other, and their common
              implementations and protocols. Let's kick things off with
              authentication and by extension, identification, you should be
              familiar with authentication in the form of username and password
              prompts when accessing things like your email. Let's take that as
              an example to show the differences between identification and
              authentication. Identification is the idea of describing an entity
              uniquely, for example, your email address is your identity when
              logging into your email. But how do you go about proving you are
              who you claim to be? That's the process we call authentication.
              When accessing your email, you're claiming to be your email
              address and you'd supply a password associated with the identity
              to prove it's you, or at least you know the password associated
              with the email account. Pretty straightforward. This is distinctly
              different from authorization, which pertains to the resources and
              identity has access to. These two concepts are usually
              distinguished from each other in the security world with the terms
              authn for authentication and authz for authorization. In our email
              account and login example, by authenticating using your email
              address and password, your identity is authorized to access your
              email inbox, but you're not authorized to access anyone else's
              inbox. We really don't want anyone else getting access to our
              inbox. What can we do to ensure that only we're able to identify
              and authenticate as our email account. We can start by ensuring
              that we're using a strong password. But what exactly constitutes a
              strong password? Well, what do you think of the password ponies?
              Would you categorize that as a strong password? I hope not. That
              password is super short and only six characters, and all of those
              characters are lowercase letters. This is a short and simple
              password, but that can be easily broken through brute force or
              dictionary based attacks. Ponies would almost definitely be in a
              dictionary file and six characters doesn't provide a large pool of
              possibilities for an attacker to try. We can ensure our password
              is strong by making it longer and more complex, adding numbers,
              uppercase letters, and special characters like punctuation. What
              do you think of the strength of this password? That seems way more
              secure, doesn't it? It adds complexity, which increases the pool
              of possible passwords and as longer at 10 characters.
              <img src="image/5/possible-password.jpeg" alt="" />
              But which of these two passwords do you think you would be able to
              remember tomorrow? Probably not the strong one. This highlights a
              super important concept in security. There's often a trade-off
              between security and usability. With our password example the more
              usable password that's easy to memorize is less secure, while the
              more secure password is much more challenging to remember. This
              concept applies to many other security subjects, not just
              passwords. You can think of security as risk mitigation. When it
              comes to risk mitigation, it's impossible to completely eliminate
              the risk. The best you can do is understand the risks your systems
              face, take measures to reduce those risks and monitor them. Think
              about it like this. The most secure computer system is one that's
              disconnected from everything, including networking and even power,
              and is locked in a concrete bunker hundreds of feet underground
              that no one has access to. While this is incredibly secure
              machine, almost impossible to compromise, it's basically useless
              since it's powered off and no one can access it. This is an
              extreme example of the security versus usability trade-off, but
              you get the point. Coming back to our password example, we
              obviously need to find some happy medium, but where we have a
              reasonably secure password that's also somewhat easy to memorize.
              How about something like this? We started with the short phrase, I
              like ponies, then replace some letters with numbers that resemble
              the letters to help with memorization. We also swapped the S with
              a Z, since they're similar sounding and tacked on some numbers as
              a suffix. At first glance, this seems like a very complex password
              and it would be hard to memorize, but it's easier than our random
              password example.
              <img src="image/5/complex-password.jpeg" alt="" />
              Problem-solved. Well, you should actually be wary of this number
              substitution process since it's well-known by attackers and
              password cracking tools. As an IT support specialist, ensuring
              that your organization uses strong passwords and practices. Good
              password hygiene are super important. They are literally the keys
              to the kingdom. What should we do? Incorporating good password
              policies into an organization is key to ensuring that employees
              are securing their accounts with strong passwords. A good password
              policy system would enforce length requirements, character
              complexity, and check for the presence of dictionary words, which
              would undermine the strength of passwords. Password should never
              be written down or recorded in plain text. Reuse the cross
              accounts or be shared with anyone. Password reuse is a risk
              because in the event the password for one account is compromised,
              other accounts using the same password would also be at risk.
              Sharing passwords should also be a no-go. Since this undermines
              the identity of an account because someone else now has the
              ability to log in as that user. Along with requiring the use of
              strong passwords, a password rotation policy is also recommended
              since this safeguards against potential undetected compromise of
              passwords. But it's important that a password rotation period
              isn't too short. Why? The inconvenience of having to change
              password so often, may actually encourage poor security behavior
              by users. Let's say you required your organization to create
              highly complex passwords and to change them every three months.
              It's very likely that a significant percentage of users would
              write down their passwords on post-it notes are on their phones, a
              big no-no. Despite the policy being designed to increase security,
              it actually has the opposite effect because of the inconvenience
              it causes your users.

              <h4>Multifactor Authentication</h4>

              Multi-factor authentication is a system where users are
              authenticated by presenting multiple pieces of information or
              objects. The many factors that comprise a multi-factor
              authentication system can be categorized into three types;
              something you know, something you have, and something you are.
              Ideally, a multi-factor system will incorporate at least two of
              these factors. Something you know would be something like a
              password or a pin for your bank or ATM card. Something you have
              would be a physical token like your ATM or bank card. Something
              you are would be a piece of biometric data, like a fingerprint or
              iris scan. The premise behind multi-factor authentication is that
              an attacker would find it much more difficult to steal or clone
              multiple factors of authentication, assuming different types are
              used. If multiple passwords are used, security isn't enhanced by
              that much. This is because passwords, however many, are still
              susceptible to phishing or keylogging attacks. By using a password
              in conjunction with a security token is a game changer. Even if
              the password is compromised by a phishing attack, the attacker
              would also need to steal or clone the physical token to be able to
              access the account. That's much less likely to happen. Physical
              tokens can take a few different forms. Common ones include a USB
              device with a secret token on it, a standalone device which
              generates a token, or even a simple key used with a traditional
              lock. A physical token that's commonly used generates a
              short-lived token, typically a number that's entered along with a
              username and password. This number is commonly called a onetime
              password or OTP, since it's short-lived and constantly changing
              value. An example of this is the RSA SecureID token. It's a small
              battery-powered device with an LCD display that shows a onetime
              password that's rotated periodically. This is a time-based token,
              sometimes called a TOTP, and operates by having a secret seed or
              randomly generated value on the token that's registered with the
              authentication server. This seed value is used in conjunction with
              the current time to generate a onetime password. Now, as long as
              the user has possession of their token or can view the display of
              the token, they're able to log in. I should also call out that the
              scheme requires the time between the authenticator token and the
              authentication server to be relatively synchronized. This is
              usually achieved by using the Network Time Protocol or NTP. An
              attacker would need to either steal the physical token, or clone
              the token if they're able to steal the secret seed value. Since a
              time-based token is synchronized with the server using time, which
              is not a secret, that would be sufficient for an attacker to clone
              a token. There are also counter-based tokens which use a secret
              seed value along with this secret counter value that's incremented
              every time a onetime password is generated on the device. The
              value is then incremented on the server upon successful
              authentication.
              <img src="image/5/counter-based-token.jpeg" alt="" />
              This is more secure than a time-based tokens for two reasons.
              First, the attacker will need to recover the seed value and the
              counter value. Second, the counter value is also incrementing when
              it's being used. A clone token would only be useful for a short
              period of time before the counter value changes too much and the
              clone token becomes unsynchronized from the real token and the
              server. These token generators can either be physical, dedicated
              devices, or they can mean app installed on a smartphone that
              performs the same functionality. Another very common method for
              handling multi-factor today is that the delivery of onetime
              password tokens using SMS. But this has been subject to some
              criticism because of the observed the tax through this channel.
              The problem with relying on SMS to transmit an additional
              authentication factor is that you're dependent on the security
              processes of the mobile carrier. SMS isn't encrypted, nor is it
              private. It's possible for SMS to be intercepted by a well-funded
              attacker. Even worse, there have been accounts of SMS-based
              multi-factor codes being stolen by calling the mobile provider.
              The attacker impersonates the owner of the line of service to
              redirect phone calls and SMS to a phone the attacker controls. If
              the attacker has already compromised the password and can get SMS
              redirected to them, they now get full access to the account. Of
              course, there's a convenience trade-off when you use a physical
              token. You have to carry around another device in order to
              authenticate. If the device is lost or damaged, the user won't be
              able to authenticate until the device is replaced. This also
              requires support overhead since devices will fail, be lost, run
              out of batteries, and get out of sync with the server. Using an
              app on a smartphone addresses some of these issues, but still
              require some additional support and inconvenience. When prompted
              to login, the user must retrieve a device or phone from their
              pocket and manually transcribe the numbers into the authentication
              page. These generated onetime passwords are also susceptible. A
              user can be tricked into going to a fake authentication page by
              sending a phishing email, something along the lines of your
              account has been compromised, please login and change your
              password immediately. When the victim enters their credentials in
              the fake page, including the onetime password, the attacker has
              all the information needed to take over the account.

              <h4>Multifactor Authentication Options</h4>

              The other category of multi-factor authentication is biometrics,
              which has gained in popularity in recent years, especially in
              mobile devices. Biometric authentication is the process of using
              unique physiological characteristics of an individual to identify
              them. By confirming the biometric signature, the individual is
              authenticated. A very common use of this in mobile devices, is
              fingerprint scanners to unlock phone. This works by registering
              your fingerprints first using an optical sensor that captures
              images of the unique pattern of your fingerprint. Much like how
              passwords should never be stored in plain text, biometric data
              used for authentication, so it also never be stored directly. This
              is even more important for handling biometric data. Unlike
              passwords, biometrics are an inherent part of who someone is, so
              there are privacy implications to theft or leaks of biometric
              data. Biometric characteristics can also be super difficult to
              change in the event that they're compromised, unlike passwords. So
              instead of storing the fingerprint data directly, the data is run
              through a hashing algorithm, and the resulting unique hash is
              stored. One advantage of biometric authentication over knowledge
              or token based systems, is that it's more reliable to identifying
              individual for authentication since biometric features aren't
              usually shareable. For example, you can't give your friend your
              fingerprints so that they can log in as you, well, you would hope
              not, anyway. But as schools start to introduce fingerprint-based
              attendance recording systems, students are finding ways to trick
              the system. They're creating fake fingerprints using things like
              glue allowing friends to mark each other as present if they're
              late or if they skip school. This is harder to achieve than
              sharing a password but it's sort of ingenious of these kids to
              think up. They really go the extra mile to skip school these days,
              not that I'm condoning this behavior. Other biometric systems use
              features like iris scans, facial recognition, gate detection and
              even voice. Microsoft developed the biometric authentication
              system for Windows 10 called Windows Hello, which supports
              fingerprint identification, iris identification and facial
              recognition. It uses two cameras, one for color and one for
              infrared, which allows for depth detection. This way it's not
              possible to trick the system using a print out of an authorized
              user's face. An evolution of physical tokens, is the U2F or
              universal second factor, it's a standard developed jointly by
              Google, Yubico, and NXP Semiconductors. The finalized standard for
              U2F are being hosted by the FIDO Alliance. U2F incorporates a
              challenge response mechanism along with public key cryptography to
              implement a more secure and more convenient second factor
              authentication solution. U2F tokens are referred to as security
              keys and are available from a range of manufacturers. Security
              keys are essentially small embedded crypto processors that have
              secure storage of asymmetric keys, and additional slots to run
              embedded code. Let's do a quick rundown on how exactly security
              keys work and how their improvement over an OTP solution. The
              first step is registration, since the security key must be
              registered with a site or service. At registration time, the
              security key generates a private public key pair unique to that
              site and submits the public key to the site for registration, it
              also binds the identity of the site with the key pair. The reason
              for unique key pairs for each site is for privacy reason. if a
              site is compromised, this prevents cross referencing registered
              public keys and discovering commonalities between sites based on
              registration data. Once registered with the site, the next time
              you're prompted to authenticate, you'll be prompted for your user
              name and password as usual. But afterwards you'll be prompted to
              tap your security key. When you physically tap the security key,
              it's a small check for user presence to ensure malware can't
              authenticate on your behalf without your knowledge. This tap will
              unlock the private keys stored in the security key which is used
              to authenticate.
              <img src="image/5/security-key.jpeg" alt="" />
              The authentication happens as a challenge response process which
              protects against replay attacks. This is because the
              authentication session can't be used again later by an
              eavesdropper, because the challenge and resulting response will be
              different with every authentication session. What happens is the
              site generates a challenge, essentially some randomized data, and
              sends this to the client that's attempting to authenticate. The
              client will then select the private key matching this site, and
              use this key to sign the challenge, and send the signed data back.
              The site can now verify the signature using the public key that
              was registered earlier, if the signature checks out, the user is
              authenticated. From a security perspective, this is a much more
              secure design than OTPs. This is because the authentication flow
              is protected from phishing attacks given the interactive nature of
              the process. Security keys are also resistant to cloning or
              forgery because they have unique embedded secrets on them and are
              protected from tampering. From the convenience perspective, this
              is a much nicer authentication flow compared to OTPs, since the
              user doesn't have to manually transcribe a string of numbers into
              the authentication dialog. All they have to do is tap their
              security key, nice and easy. As an IT support specialist, you may
              come across multi-factor authentication setups that you'd be
              responsible for supporting, you might even be tasked with helping
              to implement one. So it's important to understand how they provide
              enhanced account protection along with the options that are
              available.

                In this reading, you will learn more about physical privacy and
                security, including biometric and Near Field Communication
                authentication. You will also revisit the “confidentiality”
                aspect of the CIA Principle (Confidentiality, Integrity,
                Availability), which was introduced previously in this
                certificate program.
              </p>

              <h6>CIA Principle: Confidentiality</h6>
              <p>
                Preventing unauthorized access to an organization’s data and
                networks is imperative in protecting a company’s information
                systems. Regulations, standards, and laws may also require that
                certain information be kept confidential, like health records.
                Failing to ensure the confidentiality of specific types of data
                could result in damage to reputation, loss of customers,
                liability lawsuits, financial losses, penalty fines, criminal
                charges, and more. It is vital for IT Support specialists to
                take all measures possible to protect confidential information.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a previous video, you learned about three types of
                authentication methods:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Something you know - password or pin number</li>

                <li>
                  Something you have - bank card, USB device, key fob, or OTP
                  (one-time password)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Something you are - biometric data, like a fingerprint, voice
                  signature, facial recognition, or retinal scan
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                You will learn more about biometrics in this reading, along with
                two additional categories of authentication methods:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Somewhere you are - geofencing, GPS, Indoor Positioning
                  Systems (IPS)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Something you do - gestures, swipe patterns, CAPTCHA, or
                  patterns of behavior
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Some authentication technologies inherently require two factors:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Somewhere you are + Something you have - Near Field
                  Communication (NFC) uses both proximity to an NFC scanner and
                  a device like an NFC-enabled smartphone or an RFID chip on an
                  employee ID or bank card.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Something you are: Biometrics</h5>
              <p>
                Biometric authentication occurs in two steps: enrollment and
                authentication. Enrollment happens when the user provides their
                biometric data for the first time through a hardware scanner.
                Specific features of that biometric data are extracted,
                encrypted, and stored, often in a database or on a personal
                mobile device. Authentication, as the second step, happens when
                a user presents their biometric data again to the scanner to
                gain access to the secured item. This new scan is compared
                against the original stored biometric data to authenticate the
                person’s identity.
              </p>

              <h6>Fingerprint scanning</h6>
              <p>
                In a previous video, you learned about fingerprint scanners as
                an authentication method for mobile devices. Fingerprint
                scanners use small capacitive cells that are engineered to
                detect fingerprint ridges. Dirt and moisture can interfere with
                the scanner’s ability to do its job. As an IT Support
                specialist, you may need to replace damaged fingerprint scanners
                on customer devices.
              </p>

              <h6>Facial recognition</h6>
              <p>
                Many smartphone models provide the hardware and software to use
                facial recognition as a biometric authentication method. This
                often requires two cameras. The first camera uses normal color
                photography. The second camera uses infrared technology to
                measure depth and ensure your face is 3-dimensional. This
                prevents hackers from using photographs of the authorized users
                to unlock mobile devices.
              </p>

              Iris and Retinal scanning
              <p>
                Iris scanning is not a secure form of biometric authentication
                because a photograph of the user’s iris can be used to gain
                access. In contrast, retinal scanning is one of the more secure
                forms of biometric authentication. It is exceedingly difficult
                to impersonate the retinal features of a person’s eye. Our
                retinas have unique and complex patterns in how our blood
                vessels are arranged. These fingerprint-like patterns can be
                scanned by shining a beam of infrared light into the eye. Note
                that eye injuries and medical problems with the eyes can change
                retinal blood vessel patterns and cause users to be denied
                access to their devices. Although retinal scanning is secure,
                the technology can be expensive and difficult to implement.
              </p>
              <h5>Somewhere you are: Geolocation</h5>
              <p>
                The geographical location of a user can serve as one part of a
                multi-factor authentication policy or to deny access to users
                based on their locations. Geolocation services can use GPS, IP
                ranges, WiFi access points, cell phone towers, and/or Bluetooth
                beacons to estimate a mobile user’s location.
              </p>

              <h6>Geofencing</h6>
              <p>
                Geofencing is used to authenticate users who are physically
                within a certain radius of a specific location. For example, if
                you order food using McDonald’s smartphone app, the restaurant
                will not process your order until your smartphone is within a
                certain radius of the restaurant. You cannot send someone else
                to pick up your order either, as that person cannot authenticate
                without your smartphone being within the geofencing radius.
              </p>

              <h6>Global Positioning Systems (GPS)</h6>
              <p>
                Global Positioning Systems (GPS) use satellites orbiting Earth
                to map a device's longitude and latitude. The mobile device
                needs to be equipped with GPS sensors and have GPS services
                enabled to take advantage of GPS-based authentication
                technologies. GPS could be used to authenticate a device based
                on the physical location of the user. Insurance companies use
                GPS data to verify the authenticity of disaster claims filed
                through mobile apps.
              </p>

              <h6>Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS)</h6>
              <p>
                Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) triangulate a device’s location
                by using WiFi access points, cell phone towers, and/or Bluetooth
                beacons. Users must grant permission to apps to use this
                technology. IPS locations might be used to deny network access
                when the user has entered a restricted area.
              </p>

              <h6>Near-field communication (NFC) and scanners</h6>
              <p>
                You may have interacted with a near-field communication (NFC)
                scanner by using contactless payments with a credit card, bank
                card, or smartphone. NFC technology can also be used for
                authentication and access to physical buildings through school
                or employment ID cards.
              </p>

              <p>
                NFC transmits on the same frequency as high frequency RFID
                (13.56 MHz) and has a short distance range of 10 centimeters.
                The short distance range provides some protection from hackers
                attempting to intercept the connection to obtain your credit
                card information. However, NFC is not fully secure. An innocuous
                looking NFC scanner sitting next to an NFC-enabled payment
                device could record all NFC transactions that occur within the
                10 cm of the device in a “man in the middle” security breach.

              <h5>Something you do: Gestures and Behaviors</h5>
              <p>
                You may already be familiar with using gestures like swipe
                patterns to unlock a smartphone. Another gesture-based
                authentication method is the Picture Password, which requires
                the user to touch specific, secret points on a photograph to
                unlock the device.
              </p>

              <p>
                Patterns of people’s behaviors can be used to authenticate
                identity. For example, an organization might keep track of
                computer system login and logout times of employees. These
                patterns could be monitored for any unusual changes in employee
                behavior, which may indicate that the “employee” is instead an
                imposter.
              </p>

              <p>
                Turing tests are used to determine if an unknown entity is a
                human or a machine. You have probably responded to a CAPTCHA
                (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and
                Humans Apart) to authenticate that you are indeed a human and
                not a bot. This is accomplished by asking the user to identify
                items within a set of photographs. Photos are used for this test
                because images are more difficult for bots to identify than
                text.

              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                There are a variety of MFA protocols that can be implemented to
                protect the confidentiality, privacy, and security of data and
                networks. The 5 types of authentication can be categorized as:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Something you know - password or pin number</li>

                  Something you have - bank card, USB device, key fob, or OTP
                  (one-time password)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Something you are - biometric data, like a fingerprint, voice

              <h4>Certificates, Part Two</h4>
              As we learned earlier, certificates are public keys that are
              signed by a certificate authority or CA as a sign of trust. We
              covered TLS server certificates but there can also be client
              certificates. These operate very similarly to server certificates
              but are presented by clients and allow servers to authenticate and
              verify clients. As an IT support specialist, it's important for
              you to understand client certificates and certificate based
              authentication since you might encounter these in the course of
              your career. It's not uncommon for VPM systems or enterprise Wi-Fi
              setups to use client certificates for authentication. So
              understanding how they work will help you troubleshoot issues. In
              order to issue client certificates, an organization must setup and
              maintain CA infrastructure to issue and sign certificates. Part of
              certificate authentication also involves the client authenticating
              the server, giving us mutual authentication. This is a positive
              sense, the client can verify that it's talking to the real
              authentication server and not an impersonator. In this case, all
              clients that are using certificate authentication would also need
              to have the CA certificate in their certificate trust store. This
              establishes trust with the CA and allows the client to verify it's
              talking to the real server when trying to authenticate.
              Certificate authentication is like presenting identification at
              the airport, you show your ID or your certificate to prove who you
              are. The ID is checked to see if it was issued by an authority
              that is trusted by the verifier. Was it issued by a government
              entity or is it a novelty license from a gift shop? Obviously, one
              of those ideas would be accepted at the airport, similar to a
              certificate being signed by a trusted CA. When you're at the
              airport, the expiration date on your ID will also be checked to
              ensure it's still valid, same thing applies to certificate
              authentication. Although the certificates have two dates that need
              to be verified, not valid before and not after. Not valid before
              is checking if the certificate is valid yet, since it's possible
              to have certificates issued for future use. Not valid after is a
              straightforward expiration date after which the certificate is no
              longer valid. Airport authorities also have a list of specific IDs
              that are flagged, if your ID is on that list, then you'll be
              rejected for air travel. Similarly, the certificate will be
              checked against the revocation list or a CRL. This is a signed
              list published by the CA, which defines certificates that have
              been explicitly revoked. One last step that's performed as part of
              the authentication server verification process is to prove
              possession of the corresponding private key, since the certificate
              has a signed public key. If we don't prove possession, there's
              nothing stopping an attacker from copying the certificate since
              it's not considered secret and pretending to be the owner. To
              avoid this, possession of the private key is verified through a
              challenge response mechanism. This is where the server request a
              randomized bit of data to be signed, using the private key
              corresponding to the public key presented for authentication. This
              is similar to how the airport checks the photo on your ID, to make
              sure you look like the person in the photo and aren't
              Impersonating them.

              <h4>RADIUS</h4>

              RADIUS or remote authentication dial in user service is a protocol
              that provides AAA services for users on a network. It's a very
              common protocol used to manage access to internal networks, WiFi
              networks, email services and VPN services. Originally designed to
              transport authentication information for remote dial up users.
              It's evolved to carry a wide variety of standard authentication
              protocols EAP or extensible authentication protocol. While it's
              unlikely that you'd be responsible for configuring RADIUS server
              as an IT support specialist, you might be supporting clients that
              authenticate against a RADIUS back end server. In those cases,
              it's good to understand what role the RADIUS server plays in this
              authentication scenario. So you're better prepared to troubleshoot
              issues that may come up, clients who want to authenticate to a
              RADIUS server don't directly interact with it. Instead, when a
              client wants to access a resource that's protected, the client
              will present authentication credentials to an S. Or network access
              server which will relay the credentials to the RADIUS server. The
              RADIUS server will then verify the credentials using a configured
              authentication scheme.
              <img src="image/5/radius.jpeg" alt="" />
              RADIUS servers can verify user authentication information stored
              in a flat file or can plug into external sources like sequel
              databases, Eld app, Kerberos or active directory. Once the RADIUS
              server has evaluated the user authentication request. It replies
              with one of three messages, access, reject access challenge or
              access except

              <h4>Kerberos</h4>

              Kerberos, is a network authentication protocol that uses tickets
              to allow entities to prove their identity over potentially
              insecure channels to provide mutual authentication. It also uses
              symmetric encryption to protect protocol messages from
              eavesdropping and replay attacks. The name Kerberos is taken from
              the greek mythical character of the same name, a three headed
              guard dog protecting the gates to Hades the underworld. Seems like
              an appropriate choice for an authentication protocol, don't you
              think. Kerberos was originally developed at the Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology in the US. And was published in the 1980s
              as version four. Years later in 1993 Version 5 was published.
              Today, Kerberos supports AES encryption and implements check sums
              to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. When joined to a
              Windows Domain, Windows 2000 and newer versions will use Kerberos
              as the default authentication protocol. Microsoft also implemented
              their own Kerberos service, with some modifications to the open
              protocol. Like the addition of the RC4 stream cipher, we mentioned
              tickets earlier, which is a sort of token that proves your
              identity. They can be used for authenticating to services,
              protected using Kerberos or in other words are within the Kerberos
              realm. The authentication tickets let users authenticate two
              services without requiring user name and password authentication,
              for every service individually. A ticket will expire after some
              time, but has provisions for automatic transparent renewal of the
              ticket. Let's run down the details of how the Kerberos protocol
              operates. First, a user that wants to authenticate, enters their
              user name and password on their client machine. Their Kerberos
              client software, will then take the password and generate a
              symmetric encryption key from it. Next, the client sends a plain
              text message to the Kerberos AS or authentication server which
              includes the user ID of the authenticating user. The password or
              secret key derived from the password aren't transmitted. The AS
              uses the user ID to check if there's an account in the
              authentication database, like an active directory server. If so
              the AS will generate the secret key using the hashed passwords
              stored in the key distribution center server. The AS will then use
              the secret key to encrypt and send a message containing the client
              TGS session key. This is a secret key used for encrypting
              communications, with the ticket granting service or TGS, which is
              already known by the authentication server. The AS also sends a
              second message, with a ticket granting ticket or a TGT, which is
              encrypted using the TGS secret key. The ticket granting ticket has
              information like the client ID, Ticket validity period and the
              client ticket granting service session key. So the first message
              can be decrypted using the shared secret key derived from the user
              password. It then provides the secret key, that can decrypt the
              second message giving the client a valid ticket granting ticket.
              Now, the client has enough information to authenticate with the
              ticket granting server. Since the client has authenticated and
              received a valid ticket granting ticket, it can use the ticket
              granting ticket, to request access to services from within the
              Kerberos realm. This is done by sending a message to the ticket
              granting service, with the encrypted ticket granting ticket
              received from the AS earlier, along with the service name or ID
              the client is requesting access to. The client also sends a
              message, containing an authenticator which has the client ID and a
              time stamp, that's encrypted with the client ticket granting
              ticket session key from the AS. The ticket granting service
              decrypt the ticket granting ticket, using the ticket granting
              service secret key. Which provides the ticket granting service,
              with the client ticket granting service session key. It then uses
              the key, to decrypt the authenticator message. Next it checks the
              client ID of these two messages to ensure they match. If they do,
              it sends two messages back to the client. The first one, contains
              the client to server ticket which is comprised of the client ID,
              client address, validity period and the client server session key,
              encrypted using the services Secret key. The second message,
              contains the client server session key itself and is encrypted
              using the client ticket granted service session key. Finally, the
              client has enough information to authenticate itself to the
              service server or SS. The client sends two messages to the SS, the
              first message is the encrypted client to server ticket, received
              from the ticket granting service. The second, is a new
              authenticator with the client ID and timestamp encrypted using the
              client server session key. The SS decrypt the first message, using
              its secret key which provides it with the client server session
              key. The key is then used to decrypt the second message and it
              compares the client ID in the authenticator to the one included in
              the client to server ticket. If these ideas match, then the ss
              sends a message containing the timestamp from the client supplied
              authenticator, encrypted using the client server session key. The
              client then decrypt this message and checks at the timestamp is
              correct authenticating the server. If this all succeeds, then the
              server grants access to the requested service on the client.
              <img src="image/5/kerberos.jpeg" alt="" />
              Wow, okay are you with me, I know that was a lot. Kerberos has
              received some criticism because it's a single monolithic service.
              This creates a single point of failure danger, if the Kerberos
              service goes down, new users won't be able to authenticate and log
              in. Aside from availability issues, if the central Kerberos
              servers compromised, the attacker would be able to impersonate any
              user by generating valid Kerberos tickets for their user account.
              Kerberos enforces strict time requirements, requiring the client
              and server clocks to be relatively closely synchronized, otherwise
              authentication will fail. This is usually accomplished by using
              NTP to keep both parties synchronized using an NTP server. The
              trust model of Kerberos is also problematic, since it requires
              clients and services to have an established trust and the Kerberos
              server in order to authenticate using Kerberos. This means it's
              not possible for users to authenticate using Kerberos, from
              unknown or untrusted clients. So, things like BYOD or bring your
              own device and cloud computing, are incompatible. Or at least very
              challenging to implement securely with Kerberos authentication.
              Now, as an IT support specialist, you're likely to encounter
              Kerberos authentication, especially in environments running
              Microsoft Active directory. Understanding how the underlying
              protocol functions will help when troubleshooting issues that may
              come with it.

              <h4>TACACS+</h4>

              T-A-C-A-C-S plus pronounced, TACACS plus. It stands for Terminal
              Access Controller Access-Control System plus. It's a Cisco
              developed AAA protocol that was released as an open standard in
              1993. It replaced the older TACACS protocol developed in 1984 for
              MILNET, the unclassified network for DARPA, which later evolved
              into NIPRNet. TACACS plus also took the place of X-T-A-C-A-C-S or
              extended TACACS, which was a Cisco proprietary extension on top of
              TACACS. TACACS plus is primarily used for device administration,
              authentication, authorization, and accounting, as opposed to
              RADIUS, which is mostly used for network access, AAA. It's
              important to call out these differences in the characteristics of
              what these services provide. Though the differences are primarily
              related to the authorization and accounting portions, more so than
              authentication. While you might not encounter a TACACS plus
              implementation in the course of your support career. It's
              something that you should be aware of. TACACS plus is mainly used

              Single sign-on or SSO is an authentication concept that allows
              users to authenticate once to be granted access to a lot of
              different services and applications. Since re-authentication for
              each service isn't needed, users don't need multiple sets of
              usernames and passwords across a mix of applications and services.
              SSO is accomplished by authenticating to a central authentication
              server, like an LDAP server. This then provides a cookie or token
              that can be used to get access to applications configured to use
              SSO. Kerberos is actually a good example of an SSO authentication
              service. The user would authenticate against the Kerberos service
              once, which would then grant them a ticket-granting ticket. This
              can then be presented to the ticket-granting service in place of
              traditional credentials. The user can enter credentials once and
              gain access to a variety of services.
              <img src="image/5/single-sign-on.jpeg" alt="" />
              SSO is really convenient. It allows users to have one set of
              credentials that grant access to lots of services, making it less
              likely that passwords will be written down or stored insecurely.
              This should also reduce the overhead for password assistance
              support and removes time spent re-authenticating throughout the
              workday. So what's the downside? An attacker that manages to
              compromise an account has a lot more access under an SSO scheme.
              User credentials will grant access to all applications and
              services that that account is permitted to access. A big plug here
              for using multi-factor authentication in conjunction with an SSO
              scheme. But this opens a new channel of attack, theft of SSO
              session cookies or tokens. Instead of targeting credentials
              directly, attackers can try to steal the SSO tokens directly,
              which will permit wide access if even for a short amount of time.
              Stealing these tokens also lead to an attacker dodge multi-factor
              authentication protections, since the session token permits access
              without requiring full authentication until a token expires. An
              example of an SSO system is the OpenID decentralized
              authentication system. This is an open standard that allows
              participating sites known as relying parties to allow
              authentication of users utilizing a third-party authentication
              service. This allows sites to permit authentication without
              requiring the site itself to have authentication infrastructure,
              which can be tricky to implement and maintain. It also lets users
              access a site without requiring them to create a new account,
              simplifying access management across a wide variety of sites.
              Instead, a user just needs to already have an account with an
              identity provider. To ask for authentication, first, the relying
              party looks up the OpenID provider, then establishes a shared
              secret with the provider if one doesn't already exist. This shared
              secret will be used to validate the OpenID provider messages. Then
              the user will be redirected or asked to authenticate in a new
              window through the identities providers login flow. Once
              authenticated, the user will be prompted to confirm if they trust
              the relying party or not. Once confirmed, credentials are relayed
              to the relying party, typically in the form of a token, not actual
              user credentials, which indicates the user is now authenticated to
              the service.

              <h4>Authorization and Access Control Methods</h4>

              Earlier we covered authentication, the First component of the
              three A's of security. Next up, we'll cover authorization, which
              is usually tightly coupled with authentication. While
              authentication is related to verifying the identity of a user,
              authorization pertains to describing what the user account has
              access to or doesn't have access to. These are separate and
              distinct components of AAA that have different purposes. A user
              may successfully authenticate to a system by presenting valid
              credentials, but if the username they authenticated as isn't also
              authorized to access the system in question, they'll be denied
              access. When we talked about Kerberos earlier, the user
              authenticated and received a ticket granting ticket. This can then
              be used to request access to a specific service by sending the
              request to the ticket granting service. This is when authorization
              comes into play, since the ticket granting service will decide
              whether or not the user in question is permitted to access the
              service being requested. If they're not permitted or authorized to
              access to service, the request would be denied by the ticket
              granting service. If the user is authorized, the ticket granting
              service, would return a ticket, which authorized the user to
              access the service. One very popular open standard for
              authorization and access delegation is OAuth, used by companies
              like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Access Control</h4>

              OAuth is an open standard that allows users to grant third party
              websites and applications access to their information without
              sharing account credentials. This can be thought of as a form of
              access delegation because access to the user's account is being
              delegated to the third party. This is accomplished by prompting
              the user to confirm that they agree to permit the third party
              access to certain information about their account. Typically, this
              prompt will specifically list which pieces of information or
              access are being requested. Once confirmed, the identity provider
              will supply the third party with a token that gives them access to
              the user's information. This token can then be used by the third
              party to access data or services offered by the identity provider
              directly on behalf of the user. OAuth is commonly used to grant
              access to third party applications to APIs offered by large
              internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Let's say
              you want to use a third party meme creation website. This website
              lets you create memes using templates and gives you the option to
              save your creations and email them to your friends. Instead of the
              site sending the emails directly, which would appear to be coming
              from an address your friends wouldn't recognize. The site uses
              OAuth to get permission to send the memes using your email account
              directly. This is done by making an OAuth request to your email
              provider. Once you approve this request, the email provider issues
              an access token to the site which grants the site access to your
              email account.
              <img src="image/5/access-control.jpeg" alt="" />
              The access token would have a scope which says that it can only be
              used to access email, not other services associated with the
              account. So it can access email but not your Cloud storage files
              or calendar for example, it's important that users pay attention
              to what third party is requesting access. And what exactly they're
              granting access to. OAuth permissions can be used in phishing
              style attacks to gain access to accounts without requiring
              credentials to be compromised. This works by sending phishing
              emails to potential victims that look like legitimate OAuth
              authorization requests. Which asked the user to grant access to
              some aspects of their account through OAuth. Once the user grants
              access, the attacker has access to the account through the OAuth
              authorization token. This was used in an OAuth based worm attack
              in early 2017. There was a rash of phishing emails that appear to
              be from a friend or colleague who wanted to share a Google doc.
              When the sharing link was followed, the victim was prompted to log
              in and authorized access to email, documents. And contacts for
              some third party service which only identified itself as the name
              Google Apps. But it was actually a malicious service that would
              then email contacts from their email account perpetuating the
              attack. It's important to distinguish between OAuth and open ID.
              OAuth is specifically an authorization system and open ID is an
              authentication system though they're usually used together. Open
              ID connect is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth point
              designed to improve upon open ID, and build better integration
              with OAuth authorizations.
              <img src="image/5/oauth-open-id.jpeg" alt="" />
              Since TACACS+ is a full A A system. It also handles authorization
              along with authentication. This is done once a user is
              authenticated by allowing or disallowing access for the user
              account to run certain commands or access certain devices. This
              lets you not only allow admin access for users that administer
              devices while still allowing less privileged access to other users
              when necessary. Here's an example, since your networking teams are
              responsible for configuring and maintaining your network switches.
              Routers and other infrastructure, you'd give them admin access to
              your network and equipment. Meanwhile, you can have limited read
              only access to your support team since they don't need to be able
              to make changes to switch configurations in their jobs. Read only
              access is enough for them to troubleshoot problems. The rest of
              the user accounts would have no access at all and wouldn't be
              permitted to connect to the networking infrastructure. So more
              sophisticated or configurable AAA systems may even allow further
              refinement of authorization down to the command level. This gives
              you much more flexibility in how your access is granted to
              specific users or groups in your organization. Radius also allows
              you to authorize network access. For example, you may want to
              permit some users to have WiFi and VPN access while others may not
              need this. When they authenticate to the radius server, if the
              authentication succeeds, the radius server returns configuration
              information to the network access server. This includes
              authorizations, which specifies what network services the user is
              permitted to access.
            </div>
            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Access Control List</h4>
              An access control list or ACL is a way of defining permissions or
              authorizations for objects. The most common case you may encounter
              deals with file system permissions. A file system would have an
              ACL which is a table or database, with a list of entries
              specifying access rights for individuals or groups for various
              objects on the file system like folders, files, or programs. These
              individual access permissions per object are called access control
              entries and they make up the ACL. Individual entries can define
              permissions controlling whether or not a user or group can read,
              write or execute objects. ACLs are also used extensively in
              network security, applying access controls to routers, switches,
              and firewalls. Network ACLs are used for restricting and
              controlling access to host their services running on hosts within
              your network. Network ACLs can be defined for incoming and
              outgoing traffic. They can also be used to restrict external
              access to systems and limit outgoing traffic to enforce policies
              or to prevent unauthorized outbound data transfers.

              <h4>Tracking Usage and Access</h4>

              Last but not least, the final A of the triple AAA's of security is
              accounting. This means keeping records of what resources and
              services your users access or what they did when they were using
              your systems. A critical component of this is auditing which
              involves reviewing these records to ensure that nothing is out of
              the ordinary. If we're watching and recording usage of our systems
              but never actually checking the usage data, that's not super
              useful. So what exactly do counting systems keep track of? Well,
              that depends on the purpose and intent of the system. For example,
              a TACACS+ server would be more concerned with keeping track of
              user authentication. What systems they authenticated to and what
              commands they ran during their session. This is because TACACS+ is
              a device access AAA system that manages who has access to your
              network devices and what they do on them. Cisco's AAA system
              supports accounting of individual commands executed connection to
              and from network devices. Commands executed in privileged mode and
              network services and system details like configuration reloads or
              reboots. Radius would track details like session duration, client
              location and bandwidth or other resources used during the session.
              This is because radius is a network access AAA system so it tracks
              details about network access and usage. Radius accounting kicks
              off with the network access server sending an accounting request
              packet to the accounting server that contains an event record to
              be logged. This starts the accounting session on the server. The
              server replies with an accounting response indicating that the
              message was received. The nass will continue sending periodic
              accounting messages with statistics of the session until an
              accounting stop packet is received.
              <img src="image/5/usage-access.jpeg" alt="" />
              Radius accounting can be used for billing purposes by ISPs.
              Because it records the length of a session and the amount of data
              sent and received by the user. This data can also be used to
              enforce data or time quotas, limiting the duration of sessions or
              restricting the amount of data that can be sent or received. But
              this accounting information isn't detailed and won't contain
              specifics of what exactly the user did during the session.
              Information, like websites visited or what protocols were used
              aren't recorded.

              <h4>Network Hardening Best Practices</h4>

              Congrats on getting this far. You're over halfway through the
              course and so close to completing the program. In this section,
              we'll cover ways for you to harden your networks. Network
              hardening is the process of securing a network by reducing its
              potential vulnerabilities through configuration changes and taking
              specific steps. In the next few lessons, we'll do a deep dive on
              the best practices that an IT support specialist should know for
              implementing network hardening. We'll also discuss network
              security protection along with network monitoring and analysis.
              There's a general security principle that can be applied to most
              areas of security. It's the concept of disabling unnecessary extra
              services or restricting access to them. Since any service that's
              enabled and accessible can be attacked this principle should be
              applied to network security too. Networks would be much safer if
              you disable access to network services that aren't needed and
              enforce access restrictions. Implicit deny is a network security
              concept where anything not explicitly permitted or allowed should
              be denied. This is different from blocking all traffic, since an
              Implicit deny configuration will still let traffic pass that
              you've defined as allowed. You can do this through ACO
              configurations. This can usually be configured on a firewall,
              which makes it easier to build secure firewall rules. Instead of
              requiring you to specifically block all traffic you don't want,
              you can just create rules for traffic that you need to go through.
              You can think of this as whitelisting as opposed to blacklisting.
              Well, this is slightly less convenient, it's a much more secure
              configuration. Before a new service will work, a new rule must be
              defined for it, reducing convenience a bit. Another very important
              component of network security is monitoring and analyzing traffic
              on your network. You learned about monitoring in a previous course
              of this program. But we'll refer to monitoring in the context of
              network analysis here. There are a couple of reasons why
              monitoring your network is so important. The first is that it lets
              you establish a baseline of what your typical network traffic
              looks like. This is key because in order to know what unusual or
              potential attack traffic looks like, you need to know what normal
              traffic looks like. You can do this through network traffic
              monitoring and logs analysis. We'll dive deeper into what network
              traffic monitoring is a bit later. But let's quickly summarize how
              logs can be helpful in this context. Analyzing logs is the
              practice of collecting logs from different network and sometimes
              client devices on your network, then performing an automated
              analysis on them. This will highlight potential intrusions, signs
              of malware infections, or a typical behavior. You'd want to
              analyze things like firewall logs, authentication server logs, and
              application logs. As an IT support specialist, you should pay
              close attention to any external facing devices or services.
              They're subject to a lot more potentially malicious traffic, which
              increases the risk of compromise. Analysis of logs would involve
              looking for a specific log messages of interests, like with
              firewall logs. Attempted connections to an internal service from
              an untrusted source address may be worth investigating.
              Connections from the internal network to known address ranges of
              botnet command and control servers could mean there's a
              compromised machine on the network. As you learned in earlier
              courses of this program, log and analysis systems are a best
              practice for IT support specialist to utilize and implement. This
              is true too, for network hardening. Logs analysis systems are
              configured using user-defined rules to match interesting or a
              typical log entries. These can then be surfaced through an
              alerting system to let security engineers investigate the alert.
              Part of this alerting process would also involve categorizing the
              alert based on the rule matched. You'd also need to assign a
              priority to facilitate this investigation and to permit better
              searching or filtering. Alerts can take the form of sending an
              email or an SMS with information and a link to the event that was
              detected. You could even wake someone up in the middle of the
              night if the event was severe enough. Normalizing log data is an
              important step since logs from different devices and systems may
              not be formatted in a common way. You might need to convert log
              components into a common format to make analysis easier for
              analysts and rule-based detection systems. This also makes
              correlation analysis easier. Correlation analysis is the process
              of taking log data from different systems and matching events
              across the systems. If we see a suspicious connection coming from
              a suspect source address and the firewall logs to our
              authentication server we might want to correlate that logged
              connection with the log data of the authentication server. That
              would show us any authentication attempts made by the suspicious
              client. This type of logs analysis is also super important in
              investigating and recreating the events that happened once a
              compromise is detected. This is usually called a post fail
              analysis, since it's investigating how a compromise happened after
              the breach is detected. Detailed logging and analysis of logs
              would allow for detailed reconstruction of the events that led to
              the compromise. Hopefully, this would let the security team make
              appropriate changes to security systems to prevent further
              attacks. It could also help determine the extent and severity of
              the compromise. Detailed logging would also be able to show if
              further systems were compromised after the initial breach. It
              would also tell us whether or not any data was stolen and if it
              was what that data was. One popular and powerful logs analysis
              system is splunk, a very flexible and extensible log aggregation
              and search system. Splunk can grab logs data from a wide variety
              of systems and in large amounts of formats. It can also be
              configured to generate alerts and allows for powerful
              visualization of activity based on log data. Flood guards provide
              protection against DoS or Denial of Service Attacks. Think back to
              the CIA triad we covered earlier. Availability is an important
              tenant of security and is exactly what flood guard protections are
              designed to help ensure. This works by identifying common flood
              attack types like SYN floods or UDP floods. It then triggers
              alerts once a configurable threshold of traffic is reached.
              <img src="image/5/network1.jpeg" alt="" />

              There's another threshold called the activation threshold. When
              this one is reached, it triggers a pre-configured action. This
              will typically block the identified attack traffic for a specific
              amount of time. This is usually a feature on enterprise-grade
              routers or firewalls though it's a general security concept. A
              common open-source flood guard protection tool is fail to ban. It
              watches for signs of an attack on a system and blocks further
              attempts from a suspected attack address. Fail to ban is a popular
              tool for smaller-scale organizations. If you're the sole IT
              support specialist in your company or have a small fleet of
              machines this can be a helpful tool to use. This flood guard
              protection can also be described as a form of intrusion prevention
              system. Network separation or network segmentation is a good
              security principle for an IT support specialist to implement. It
              permits more flexible management of the network and provides some
              security benefits.
              <img src="image/5/network2.jpeg" alt="" />
              This is the concept of using V lens to create virtual networks for
              different device classes or types. Think of it as creating
              dedicated virtual networks for your employees to use, but also
              having separate networks for your printers to connect to. The idea
              here is that the printers won't need access to the same network
              resources than employees do. It probably doesn't make sense to
              have the printers on the employee network. You might be wondering
              how employees are supposed to print if the printers are on a
              different network. It's actually one of the benefits of network
              separation since we can control and monitor the flow of traffic
              between networks more easily. To give employees access to
              printers, we'd configure routing between the two networks on our
              routers. We'd also implement network ackles that permit the
              appropriate traffic. Required en ​

              <h4>Network Hardware Hardening</h4>

              In this video, we'll cover some ways that an IT support specialist
              can implement network hardware hardening. In an earlier lesson on
              networking, we explored DHCP. It's the protocol where devices on a
              network are assigned critical configuration information for
              communicating on the network. You also learned about configuring
              DHCP in another course of this program. You can see how DHCP is a
              target of attackers because of the important nature of the service
              it provides. If an attacker can manage to deploy a rogue DHCP
              server on your network, they could hand out DHCP leases with
              whatever information they want. This include setting a gateway
              address or DNS server that's actually a machine within their
              control. This gives them access to your traffic and opens the door
              for future attacks. Yikes. We call this type of attack a rogue
              DHCP server attack. To protect against this rogue DHCP server
              attack, enterprise switches off a feature called DHCP snooping. A
              switch that has DHCP snooping will monitor DHCP traffic being sent
              across it.
              <img src="image/5/hardware-hardening.jpeg" alt="" />
              It will also track IP assignments and map them to hosts connected
              to switch ports. This basically builds a map of assigned IP
              addresses to physical switch ports. This information can also be
              used to protect against IP spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks.
              DHCP snooping also makes you designate either a trusted DHCP
              server IP if it's operating as a DHCP helper and forwarding DHCP
              requests to the server. Or you can enable DHCP snooping trust on
              the uplinked port, where legitimate DHCP responses would now come
              from. Now, any DHCP responses coming from either an untrusted IP
              address or from a downlink switch port would be detected as
              untrusted and discarded by the switch. Let's talk about another
              form of network hardware hardening, dynamic ARP inspection. ARP
              allows for a Layer 2 man-in-the-middle attack because of the
              unauthenticated nature of ARP. It allows an attacker to forge an
              ARP response advertising its MAC address as the physical address
              matching a victim's IP address. This type of ARP response is
              called a gratuitous ARP response, since it's effectively answering
              a query that no one made. When this happens, all of the clients on
              the local network segment would cache this ARP entry. Because of
              the forged ARP entry, they send frames intended for the victim's
              IP address to the attacker's machine instead. The attacker could
              enable IP forwarding, which would let them transparently monitor
              traffic intended for the victim. They could also manipulate or
              modify data. Dynamic ARP Inspection or DAI, is another feature on
              enterprise switches that prevents this type of attack. It requires
              the use of DHCP snooping to establish a trusted binding of IP
              addresses to switch ports. DAI would detect these forged
              gratuitous ARP packets and drop them. It does this because it has
              a table from DHCP snooping that has the authoritative IP address
              assignments per port.
              <img src="image/5/hardware-hardening2.jpeg" alt="" />
              DAI also enforces rate-limiting of ARP packets per port to prevent
              ARP scanning. An attacker is likely to ARP scan before attempting
              the ARP attack. To prevent IP spoofing attacks, IP Source Guard or
              IPSG can be enabled on enterprise switches along with DHCP
              snooping. If you're an IT support specialist at a small company
              that uses enterprise class switch hardware, you'll probably
              utilize IPSG. It works by using the DHCP snooping table to
              dynamically create hackles for each switch port. This dropped
              packets that don't match the IP address for the port based on a
              DHCP snooping table. If you really want to lock down your network,
              you can implement 802.1X. It's important for an IT support
              specialist to be aware of 802.1X. This is the IEEE standard for
              encapsulating EAP or Extensible Authentication Protocol traffic
              over the 802 networks. This is also called EAP over Lan or EAPoL.
              It was originally designed for Ethernet, but support was added for
              other network types like Wi-Fi and fiber networks. We won't go
              into the details of all EAP authentication types supported. There
              are about 100 compatible types, so it would take way too long. But
              we'll take a closer look at EAP-TLS since it's one of the more
              common and secure EAP methods. When a client wants to authenticate
              to a network using 802.1X, there are three parties involved. The
              client device is what we call the supplicant. It's sometimes also
              used to refer to the software running on the client machine that
              handles the authentication process for the user. The open source
              Linux utility, WPA supplicant is one of those.
              <img src="image/5/harware-hardening3.jpeg" alt="" />
              The supplicant communicates with the authenticator, which acts as
              a gatekeeper for the network. It requires clients to successfully
              authenticate to the network before they're allowed to communicate
              with the network. This is usually an enterprise switch or an
              access point in the case of wireless networks. It's important to
              call out that while the supplicant communicates with the
              authenticator, it's not actually the authenticator that makes the
              authentication decision. The authenticator acts like a go-between
              and forwards the authentication request to the authentication
              server. That's where the actual credential verification and
              authentication occurs. The authentication server is usually a
              radius server. EAP-TLS is an authentication type supported by EAP
              that uses TLS to provide mutual authentication of both the client
              and the authenticating server. This is considered one of the more
              secure configurations for wireless security. So it's definitely
              possible that you'll encounter this authentication type in your IT
              career. Like with many of these protocols, understanding how it
              works can help you if you need to troubleshoot. You might remember
              from Course 4 that HTTPS is a combination of the Hypertext
              Transfer Protocol, HTTP, with SSL-TLS cryptographic protocols.
              When TLS is implemented for HTTPS traffic, it specifies a client
              certificate as an optional factor of authentication.
              <img src="image/5/tls-tunnel.jpeg" alt="" />
              Similarly, most EAP-TLS implementations require client-side
              certificates. Authentication can be certificate based, which
              requires a client to present a valid certificate that's signed by
              the authenticating CA. Or a client can use a certificate in
              conjunction with a username, password, and even a second factor of
              authentication like a onetime password. The security of EAP-TLS
              stems from the inherent security that the TLS protocol and PKI
              provide. That also means that the pitfalls are the same when it
              comes to properly managing PKI elements. You have to safeguard
              private keys appropriately and ensure distribution of the CA
              certificate to client devices to allow verification of the server
              side. Even more secure configuration for EAP-TLS would be to bind
              the client-side certificates to the client platforms using TPMs.
              This would prevent theft of the certificates from client machines.
              When you combine this with FDE, even theft of a computer would
              prevent compromise of the network. We're covering a lot of complex
              processes right now. Feel free to watch this video again so that
              the material really sinks in. Keep in mind, as an IT support
              specialist, you don't need to know every single step-by-step
              detail here. Knowing what these processes are and how they work
              can be very beneficial while troubleshooting and evaluating
              infrastructure security.

              <h4>Network Software Hardening</h4>

              Hey, welcome back. In the last lesson, we covered Network,
              Hardware hardening security measures, which you should be aware of
              as an IT support specialist. Now, we're going to shift to Network
              Software hardening techniques. Just like with network hardware
              hardening, it's important for you to know how to implement network
              software hardening, which includes things like firewalls, proxies,
              and VPNs. These security software solutions will play an important
              role in securing networks and their traffic for your organization,
              like we mentioned before, firewalls are critical to securing a
              network. They can be deployed as dedicated network infrastructure
              devices which regulate the flow of traffic for a whole network.
              They can also be host-based as software that runs on a client
              system providing protection for that one host only. It's generally
              recommended to deploy both solutions. A host-based firewall
              provides protection for mobile devices, such as a laptop that
              could be used in an untrusted, potentially malicious environment,
              like an airport Wi-Fi hotspot. Host-based firewalls are also
              useful for protecting other hosts from being compromised by
              corrupt device on the internal network.
              <img src="image/5/host-based-firewalls.jpeg" alt="" />
              That's something a network-based firewall may not be able to help
              defend against. You will almost definitely encounter host-based
              firewalls since all major operating systems have built-in ones
              today. It's also very likely that your company will have some kind
              of network-based firewall. Your router at home even has a
              network-based firewall built-in. VPNs are also recommended to
              provide secure access to internal resources for mobile or roaming
              users. We won't go back over all the details, but here's a quick
              rundown. VPNs are commonly used to provide secure remote access
              and link two networks securely. Let's say we have two offices,
              located in buildings that are on opposite sides of town. We want
              to create one unified network that would let users in each
              location seamlessly connect to devices and services in either
              location. We could use a site-to-site VPN to link these two
              offices to the people in the offices, everything would just work.
              <img src="image/5/site-to-site-vpn.jpeg" alt="" />

              They'd be able to connect to a service hosted in the other office
              without any specific configuration. Using a VPN tunnel, all
              traffic between the two offices can be secured using encryption.
              This lets the two remote networks join each other seamlessly. This
              way, clients on one network can access devices on the other
              without requiring them to individually connect to a VPN service.
              Usually, the same infrastructure can be used to allow remote
              access VPN services for individual clients that require access to
              internal resources while out of the office. Proxies can be really
              useful to protect client devices and their traffic. They also
              provide secure remote access without using a VPN. A standard web
              proxy can be configured for client devices. This allows web
              traffic to be proxy through a proxy server that we control for
              lots of purposes. This configuration can be used for logging web
              requests of client devices. The devices can be used for logs and
              traffic analysis and forensic investigation. The proxy server can
              be configured to block content that might be malicious, dangerous,
              or just against company policy.
              <img src="image/5/proxy-server.jpeg" alt="" />
              A reverse proxy can be configured to allow secure remote access to
              web-based services without requiring a VPN. Now, as an IT support
              specialist, you may need to configure or maintain a reverse proxy
              service as an alternative to VPN. By configuring a reverse proxy
              at the edge of your network, connection requests to services
              inside the network coming from outside are intercepted by the
              reverse proxy. They are then forwarded onto the internal service
              with the reverse proxy acting as a relay.
              <img src="image/5/reverse-proxy-server.jpeg" alt="" />
              These bridges communications between the remote client outside the
              network and the internal service. This proxy setup can be secured
              even more by requiring the use of client TLS certificates, along
              with username and password authentication. Specific ACLs can also
              be configured on the reverse proxy to restrict access even more.
              Lots of popular proxy solutions support a reverse proxy
              configuration like HAProxy, Nginx, and even the Apache web server.

              <h4>WEP Encryption and Why You Shouldn't Use It</h4>

              In this lesson, we'll cover the best practices for implementing
              wireless security. As an IT support specialist, you'll be
              responsible for Wi-Fi configuration and infrastructure.
              Understanding the security options available for wireless networks
              is super important to making sure that the best solution is
              chosen. We already covered the nuts and bolts of the wireless
              802.11 protocol and explained how wireless networks work. We won't
              rehash that. But we'll take a closer look at the security
              implementations available to protect wireless networks. Before we
              jump into the nitty-gritty details of wireless security, take a
              second and ask yourself this question. What do you think the best
              security option is for securing a Wi-Fi network? It's okay if
              you're not sure. Just keep this question in mind as we go over all
              the options available along with their benefits and drawbacks.
              Spoiler alert, there's some pretty technical security stuff coming
              your way. So put your thinking caps on. The first security
              protocol introduced for Wi-Fi networks was WEP, or Wired
              Equivalent Privacy. It was part of the original 802.11 standard
              introduced back in 1997. WEP was intended to provide privacy on
              par with a wired network. That means the information passed over
              the network should be protected from third parties eavesdropping.
              This was an important consideration when designing the wireless
              specification. Unlike wire networks, packets could be intercepted
              by anyone with physical proximity to the access point or client
              station. Without some form of encryption to protect the packets,
              wireless traffic would be readable by anyone nearby who wants to
              listen. WEP was proven to be seriously bad at providing
              confidentiality or security for wireless networks. It was quickly
              discounted in 2004 in favor of more secure systems. Even so, we'll
              cover it here for historical purposes. I want to drive home the
              point that no one should be using WEP anymore. You never know. You
              may see seriously outdated systems when working as an IT support
              specialist. It's important that you fully understand why WEP is
              outdated and what you can do instead. WEP use the RC4 symmetric
              stream cipher for encryption. It used either a 40-bit or 104-bit
              shared key, where the encryption key for individual packets was
              derived. The actual encryption key for each packet was computed by
              taking the user-supplied shared key and then joining a 24-bit
              initialization vector, or IV for short. It's a randomized bit of
              data to avoid reusing the same encryption key between packets.
              <img src="image/5/wep-wifi.jpeg" alt="" />

              Since these bits of data are concatenated or joined, a 40-bit
              shared key scheme uses a 64-bit key for encryption, and the
              104-bit scheme uses 128-bit key. Originally, WEP encryption was
              limited to 64-bit only because of US export restrictions placed on
              encryption technologies. Now, once those laws were changed,
              128-bit encryption became available for use. The shared key was
              entered as either 10 hexadecimal characters for 40-bit WEP or 26
              hex characters for 104-bit WEP. Each hex character was four bits
              each. The key could also be specified by supplying five ASCII
              characters, or 13, each ASCII character representing eight bits.
              But this actually reduces the available keyspace to only valid
              ASCII characters instead of all possible hex values. Since this is
              a component of the actual key, the shared key must be exactly as
              many characters as appropriate for the encryption scheme. WEP
              authentication originally supported two different modes; open
              system authentication and shared key authentication. The open
              system mode didn't require clients to supply credentials. Instead,
              they were allowed to authenticate and associate with the access
              point. But the access point would begin communicating with the
              client encrypting data frames with the pre-shared WEP key. If the
              client didn't have the key or had an incorrect key, it wouldn't be
              able to decrypt the frames coming from the access point or AP. It
              also wouldn't be able to communicate back to the AP. Shared key
              authentication worked by requiring clients to authenticate through
              a four-step challenge response process. This basically has the AP
              asking the client to prove that they have the correct key. Here's
              how it works. The client sends an authentication request to the
              AP. The AP replies with a clear text challenge a bit of randomized
              data that the client is supposed to encrypt using the shared WEP
              key. The client replies to the AP with the resulting ciphertexts
              from encrypting this challenge text. The AP verifies this by
              decrypting the response and checking it against the plain text
              challenge text. If they match, a positive response is sent back.
              <img src="image/5/wep-key.jpeg" alt="" />
              Does anything jump out at us potentially insecure in the scheme?
              We're transmitting both the plaintext and the ciphertext in a way
              that exposes both of these messages to potential eavesdroppers.
              This opens the possibility for the encryption key to be recovered
              by the attacker. A general concept in security and encryption is
              to never send the plaintext and cipher text together, so that
              attackers can't work out the key used for encryption. But WEP's
              true weakness wasn't related to the authentication schemes. Its
              use of the RC4 stream cipher and how the IVs were used to generate
              encryption keys led to WEP's ultimate downfall. The primary
              purpose of an IV is to introduce more random elements into the
              encryption key to avoid reusing the same one. When using a stream
              cipher like RC4, it's super important than an encryption key
              doesn't get reused. This would allow an attacker to compare two
              messages encrypted using the same key and recover information. But
              the encryption key in WEP is just made up of the shared key, which
              doesn't change frequently. It had 24 bits of randomized data,
              including the IV tacked onto the end of it. This results in only a
              24-bit pool where unique encryption keys will be pulled from
              unused. Since the IV is made up of 24 bits of data, then total
              number of possible values is not very big by modern computing
              standards. That's only about 17 million possible unique IVs, which
              means after roughly 5,000 packets, an IV will be reused. When an
              IV is reused, the encryption key is also reused. It's also
              important to call out that the IV is transmitted in plain text. If
              it were encrypted, the receiver would not be able to decrypt it.
              This means an attacker just has to keep track of IVs and watch for
              repeated ones. The actual attack that lets an attacker recover the
              WEP key relies on weaknesses in some IVs and how the RC4 cipher
              generates a key-stream used for encrypting the data payloads. This
              lets the attacker reconstruct this key-stream using packets
              encrypted using the weak IVs. The details of the attack are
              outside what we'll cover in this course. You can also take a look
              at open source tools that demonstrate this attack in action, like
              Aircrack-ng or AirSnort. They can recover a WEP key in a matter of
              minutes. It's terrifying to think about. You might be asking
              yourself why it's important to know WEP since it's not recommended
              for use anymore. Well, as an IT support specialist, you might
              encounter some cases where legacy hardware is still running WEP.
              It's important to understand the security implications of using
              this broken security protocol, so you can prioritize upgrading
              away from web.

              <h4>Let's Get Rid of WEP!</h4>

              The replacement for web from the Wi-Fi Alliance was WPA or Wi-Fi
              Protected Access. WPA was designed as a short-term replacement
              that would be compatible with older WEP-enabled hardware with a
              simple firmware update. This helped with user adoption because it
              didn't require the purchase of new Wi-Fi hardware. To address the
              shortcomings of WEP security, a new security protocol was
              introduced called TKIP or the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol.
              TKIP implemented three new features that made it more secure than
              WEP. First, a more secure key derivation method was used to more
              securely incorporate the IV into the per packet encryption key.
              Second, a sequence counter was implemented to prevent replay
              attacks by rejecting out-of-order packets. Third, a 64-bit MIC or
              message integrity check was introduced to prevent forging,
              tampering, or corruption of packets. TKIP still use the RC4 cipher
              as the underlying encryption algorithm, but it addressed the key
              generation weaknesses of web by using a key mixing function to
              generate unique encryption keys per packet. It also utilizes
              256-bit long keys.
              <img src="image/5/tkip.jpeg" alt="" />
              This key mixing function incorporates the long-lived Wi-Fi
              passphrase with the IV. This is different compared to the
              simplistic concatenation of the shared key and IV. Under WPA, the
              pre-shared key is the Wi-Fi password you share with people when
              they come over and want to use your wireless network. This is not
              directly used to encrypt traffic. It's used as a factor to derive
              the encryption key. The passphrase is fed into the PBKDF2 or
              Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 along with the Wi-Fi
              network's SSID as a salt. This is then run through the HMAC-SHA1
              function 4,096 times to generate a unique encryption key. The SSID
              salt is incorporated to help defend against rainbow table attacks.
              The 4,096 rounds of HMAC-SHA1 increase the computational power
              required for a brute force attack. I should call out that the
              pre-shared key can be entered using two different methods. A
              64-character hexadecimal value can be entered or the 64-character
              value is used as the key, which is 64 hexadecimal characters times
              4 bits, which is 256 bits. The other option is to use PBKDF2
              function, but only if entering ASCII characters as a passphrase.
              If that's the case, the passphrase can be anywhere 8-63 characters
              long. You might encounter WPS in a small IT shop that uses
              commercial SOHO routers. It can be useful in these smaller
              environments to make it easier to join wireless clients to the
              wireless network securely, but there are security implications to
              having enabled that you should be aware of. The Wi-Fi Alliance
              introduced WPS in 2006. It provides several different methods that
              allow our wireless client to securely join a wireless network
              without having to directly enter the pre-shared key. This
              facilitates the use of very long and secure passphrases without
              making it unnecessarily complicated. WPS simplifies this by
              allowing for secure exchange of the SSID and pre-shared key. This
              is done after authenticating or exchanging data using one of the
              four supported methods. WPS supports PIN entry authentication, NFC
              or USB for out-of-band exchange of the network details, or push
              button authentication. You've probably seen the push button
              mechanism. It's typically a small button somewhere on the home
              router with two arrows pointing counterclockwise. The push button
              mechanism works by requiring a button to be pressed on both the AP
              side and the client side. This requires physical proximity and a
              short window of time that the client can authenticate with a
              button press of its own. The NFC and USB methods just provide a
              different channel to transmit the details to join the network. The
              PIN methods are really interesting and also where critical flow
              was introduced. The PIN authentication mechanism supports two
              modes. In one mode, the client generates a pin, which is then
              entered into the AP. In the other mode, the AP has a pin typically
              hard-coded into the firmware, which is entered into the client.
              It's the second mode that is vulnerable to an online brute force
              attack. The PIN authentication method uses pins that are eight
              digits long, but the last digit is a checksum that's computed from
              the first seven digits. This makes the total number of possible
              pins 10^7 or around 10 million possibilities. But the pin is
              authenticated by the AP in halves. This means the client will send
              the first four digits of the AP, wait for a positive or negative
              response, and then send the second half of the pin if the first
              half was correct. Did you see anything wrong with this scenario?
              We're actually reducing the total possible valid pins even more
              and making it even easier to guess what the correct pin is. The
              first half of the pin, being four digits, has about 10,000
              possibilities. The second half, only three digits because of the
              checksum value, has a maximum of only 1,000 possibilities. This
              means the correct pin can be guessed in a maximum of 11,000 tries.
              It sounds like a lot, but it really isn't. Without any rate
              limiting, an attacker could recover the pin and the pre-shared key
              in less than four hours. In response to this, the Wi-Fi Alliance
              revise the requirements for the WPS specification, introducing a
              lockout period of one minute after three incorrect pin attempts.
              This increases the maximum time to guess the pin from four hours
              to less than three days. That's easily in the realm of possibility
              for determined and patient attacker, but it gets worse. If your
              network is compromised using this attack because the pin is an
              unchanging element that's part of the AP configuration, the
              attacker could just reuse the already recovered WPS pin to get the
              new password. This would happen even if you detected unauthorized
              wireless clients on your network and changed your Wi-Fi password.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>WPA2</h4>

              WPA2 improves WPA security even more by implementing CCMP or
              Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol. It's based on the AES cipher
              finally getting away from the insecure RC4 cipher. The key
              derivation process didn't change from WPA and the pre-shared key
              requirements are the same. Counter with CBC MAC is a particular
              mode of operation for block ciphers. It allows for authenticated
              encryption, meaning data is kept confidential and is
              authenticated. This is accomplished using an authenticate then
              encrypt mechanism. The CBC MAC Digest is computed first, then the
              resulting authentication code is encrypted along with the message
              using a block cipher. We're using AES in this case operating
              encounter mode. This turns a block cipher into a stream cipher by
              using a random seed value along with an incremental counter to
              create a key stream to encrypt data with.
              <img src="image/5/wpa2.jpeg" alt="" />
              Now, let's walk through the four-way handshake process that
              authenticates clients of the network. It'll help you understand
              how WPA2 can be broken. This process also generates the temporary
              encryption key that will be used to encrypt data for this client.
              It's designed to allow an AP to confirm that the client has the
              correct pairwise master key or pre-shared key in a WPA-PSK setup
              without disclosing the PMK. PMK is a long-lived key and might not
              change for a long time. So an encryption key is derived from the
              PMK that's used for actual encryption and decryption of traffic
              between a client and AP. This key is called the Pairwise Transient
              Key or PTK. The PTK is generated using the PMK, AP nonce, Client
              nonce, AP MAC address, and Client MAC address. They're all
              contaminated together and run through a function. The AP and
              Client nonces are just random bits of data generated by each party
              and exchanged. The MAC addresses of each party would be known
              through the packet headers already and both parties should already
              have the correct PMK. With this information, the PTK can be
              generated. This is different for every client to allow for
              confidentiality between clients. The PTK is actually made up of
              five individual keys, each with their own purpose. Two keys are
              used for encryption and confirmation of EAPoL packets and the
              encapsulating protocol carries these messages. Two keys are used
              for sending and receiving message integrity codes and finally,
              there's a temporal key which is actually used to encrypt data. The
              AP will also transmit the GTK or GroupWise Transient Key. It's
              encrypted using the EAPoL encryption key contained in the PTK,
              which is used to encrypt multicast or broadcast traffic. Since
              this type of traffic must be readable by all clients connected to
              an AP, this GTK is shared between all clients. It's updated and
              re-transmitted periodically when a client disassociates the AP.
              That's a lot to take in so let's recap. The four messages
              exchanged in order are the AP which sends ANonce to the client.
              The client then sends its ANonce to the AP. The AP sends the GTK
              and the client replies with an Ack confirming successful
              negotiation.
              <img src="image/5/wpa2-2.jpeg" alt="" />
              The WPA and WPA2 Standard, also introduced in 802.1X
              authentication to Wi-Fi networks. It's usually called WPA2-
              Enterprise. The non-802.1X configurations are called either
              WPA2-Personal or WPA 2- PSK. Since they use a pre-shared key to
              authenticate clients, we won't rehash 802.1X here since it
              operates similarly to 802.1X on wired networks which we covered
              earlier. The only thing different is that the AP acts as the
              authenticator in this case. The back end radius is still the
              authentication server and the PMK is generated using components of
              the EAP method chosen. While not a security feature directly, WPS
              or Wi-Fi-protected setup is a convenience feature designed to make
              it easier for clients to join a WPA-PSK-protected network. WPA2 is
              a really robust security protocol. It's built using best-in-class
              mechanisms to prevent attacks and ensure the confidentiality of
              the data it's protecting even so it's susceptible to some forms of
              attack. The four-way authentication handshake that we covered
              earlier is actually susceptible to an offline brute-force attack.
              If an attacker can manage to capture the four-way handshake
              process, just four packets, they can begin guessing the pre-shared
              key or PMK. They can take the nonces and MAC addresses from the
              four-way handshake packets and computing PTKs. Since the message
              authentication code secret keys are included as part of the PTK,
              the correct PMK guess would yield a PTK that successfully
              validates a mike.
              <img src="image/5/brut-force-attack.jpeg" alt="" />
              This is a brute force or dictionary-based attack so it's dependent
              on the quality of the password guesses. It does require a fair
              amount of computational power to calculate the PMK from the
              passphrase guesses and SSID values. But the bulk of the
              computational requirements lies in the PMK computation. This
              requires 4096 iterations of a hashing function which can be
              massively accelerated through the use of GPU-accelerated
              computation and cloud computing resources. Because of the bulk of
              the computations involving computing the PMK by incorporating the
              password guesses with the SSIDs, it's possible to pre-compute PMKs
              in bulk for common SSIDs and password combinations. This reduces
              the computational requirements to deriving the PTK from the unique
              session elements. These pre-computed sets are referred to as
              rainbow tables, and exactly this has been done. Rainbow tables are

              <h4>Wireless Hardening</h4>
              Now that we've covered the security options available for
              protecting wireless networks, what do you think the most secure
              option would be? In an ideal world, we'd all be protecting our
              wireless networks using 802.1X with EAP-TLS, it offers arguably
              the best security available, assuming proper and secure handling
              of the PKI aspects of it. But this option also requires a ton of
              added complexity and overhead. This is because it requires the use
              of a radius server and an additional authentication back-end at a
              minimum. If EAP-TLS is implemented, then all the public key
              infrastructure components will also be necessary. This adds even
              more complexity and management overhead. Not only do you have to
              securely deploy PKI on the back-end first certificate management,
              but a system must be in place to sign the client certificates. You
              also have to distribute them to each client that would be
              authenticating to the network. This is usually more overhead than
              many companies are willing to take on because of the security
              versus convenience trade-off involved. If 802.1X is too
              complicated for a company, the next best alternative would be WPA2
              with AES/CCMP mode. But to protect against brute force or rainbow
              table attacks, we should take some steps to raise the
              computational bar.
              <p class="important">
                A long and complex passphrase that wouldn't be found in a
                dictionary would increase the amount of time and resources and
                attacker would need to break the passphrase.
              </p>
              Changing the SSID to something uncommon and unique would also make
              rainbow tables attack less likely. It would require an attacker to
              do the computations themselves, increasing the time and resources
              required to pull off an attack. When using a long and complex
              Wi-Fi password, you might be tempted to use WPS to join clients to
              the network. But we saw earlier that this might not be a good idea
              from a security perspective. In practice, you won't see WPS
              enabled in an enterprise environment because it's a
              consumer-oriented technology. If your company values security over
              convenience, you should make sure that WPS isn't enabled on your
              APs. Makes sure this feature is disabled on your APs management
              council. You might want to also verify the feature is actually
              disabled using a tool like Wash, which scans and enumerates APs
              that have WPS enabled. This independent verification is
              recommended, sent some router manufacturers don't allow you to
              disable it. In some cases, disabling the feature through the
              management console doesn't actually disable the feature.

            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Sniffing the Network</h4>
              Now in order to monitor what type of traffic is on your network
              you need a mechanism to capture packets from network traffic for
              analysis and potential logging. Packet sniffing or packet capture
              is the process of intercepting network packets in their entirety
              for analysis. It's an invaluable tool for IT support specialists
              to troubleshoot issues. There are lots of tools that make this
              really easy to do. Before we dive into the details of how to use
              them, let's cover some basic concepts of packet sniffing. By
              default network interfaces and the networking software stack on an
              OS are going to behave like a well mannered interface. It will
              only be accepting and processing packets that are addressed to its
              specific interface address usually identified by a mac address. If
              a packet with a different destination address is encountered the
              interface will just drop the packet. But if we wanted to capture
              all packets that an interface is able to see like when we're
              monitoring all network traffic on a network segment, this behavior
              would be a pain for us. To override this we can place the
              interface into what's called promiscuous mode. This is a special
              mode for ethernet network interfaces that basically says give me
              all the packets. Instead of only accepting and handling packets
              destined for its address, it will now accept and process any
              packet that it sees. This is much more useful for network analysis
              or monitoring purposes. I should also call out that admin or root
              privileges are needed to place an interface into promiscuous mode
              and to begin to capture packets. Many packet capture tools will
              handle this for you too. Another super important thing to consider
              when you perform packet captures is whether you have access to the
              traffic you like to capture and monitor. Let's say you wanted to
              analyze all traffic between hosts connected to a switch and your
              machine is also connected to a port on this switch.
              <img src="image/5/traffic-on-switch.jpeg" alt="" />
              What traffic would you be able to see in this case? Riproduci il
              video a partire da :1:59 e segui la trascrizione1:59 Because this
              is a switch the only traffic you'd be able to capture would be
              traffic from your host or destined for your host. That's not very
              useful in letting you analyze other host traffic. If the packets
              aren't going to be sent to your interface in the first place,
              promiscuous mode won't help you see them. But if your machine was
              inserted between the uplink port of the switch and the uplink
              device further upstream now you'd have access to all packets in
              and out of that local network segment. Enterprise managed switches
              usually have a feature called port mirroring which helps with this
              type of scenario. Port mirroring allows the switch to take all
              packets from a specified port, port range or the entire VLAN and
              mirror the packets to a specified switch port. This lets you gain
              access to all packets passing on a switch in a more convenient and
              secure way. There's another handy the less advanced way that you
              can get access to packets in a switch network environment. You can
              insert a hub into the topology with the device or devices you'd
              like to monitor traffic on connected to the hub and our monitoring
              machine. Hubs are a quick and dirty way of getting packets
              mirrored to your capture interface. They obviously have drawbacks
              though like reduced throughput and the potential for introducing
              collisions. Riproduci il video a partire da :3:18 e segui la
              trascrizione3:18 If you capture packets from a wireless network,
              the process is slightly different. Promiscuous mode applied to a
              wireless device would allow the wireless client to process and
              receive packets from the network it's associated with destined for
              other clients. But if we wanted to capture and analyze all
              wireless traffic that we're able to receive in the immediate area,
              we can place our wireless interface into a mode called monitor
              mode. Monitor mode allows us to scan across channels to see all
              wireless traffic being sent by APs and clients. It doesn't matter
              what networks they're intended for and it wouldn't require the
              client device to be associated or connected to any wireless
              network. To capture wireless traffic all you need is an interface
              placed into monitor mode. Just like enabling promiscuous mode this
              can be done with a simple command, but usually the tools used for
              wireless packet captures can handle the enabling and disabling of
              the mode for you. You need to be near enough to the AP and client
              to receive a signal, and then you can begin capturing traffic
              right out of the air. There are a number of open source wireless
              capture and monitoring utilities, like aircrack-ng and Kismet.
              It's important to call out that if a wireless network is
              encrypted, you can still capture the packets, but you won't be
              able to decode the traffic payloads without knowing the password
              for the wireless network.

              <h4>Wireshark and tcpdump</h4>
              Tcpdump is a super popular lightweight command line-based utility
              that you can use to capture and analyze packets. Tcpdump uses the
              open-source libpcap library. That's a very popular packet capture
              library that's used in a lot of packet capture and analysis tools.
              Tcpdump also supports writing packet captures to a file for later
              analysis, sharing or replaying traffic. It also supports reading
              packet captures back from a file. Tcpdump's default operating mode
              is to provide a brief packet analysis. It converts key information
              from layers 3 and up into human-readable formats. Then it prints
              information about each packet to standard out or directly into
              your terminal. It does things like converting the source and
              destination IP addresses into the dotted quad format we're most
              used to and it shows the port numbers being used by the
              communications. Let's quickly walk through the output of a sample
              Tcpdump. The first bit of information is fairly straightforward.
              It's a timestamp that represents when the packet on this line was
              processed by the kernel in local time. Next the Layer 3 protocol
              is identified. In this case, it's IPV4. After this, the connection
              quad is shown. This is the source address, source port,
              destination address, and destination port. Next the TCP flags and
              the TCP sequence number are set on the packet, if there are any.
              This is followed by the act number, TCP window size, then TCP
              options if there are any set. Finally, we have payload size in
              bytes. Remember these from a few lessons ago when we covered
              networking, Tcpdump allows us to actually inspect these values
              from packets directly. I want to call out that Tcpdump by default
              will attempt to resolve host addresses to host names. It will also
              replace port numbers with commonly associated services that use
              these ports. You can override this behavior with the dash n flag.
              It's also possible to view the actual raw data that makes up the
              packet. This is represented as hexadecimal digits by using the
              dash X flag or X if you want the X in ascii interpretation of the
              data. Remember that packets are just collections of data or
              groupings of ones and zeros. They represent information depending
              on the values of this data and where they appear in the data
              stream. Think back to packet headers and how those are structured
              and formatted. The view Tcpdump gives us, let's see the data that
              fits into the various fields that make up the headers for layers
              and a packet. Wireshark is another packet capture and analysis
              tool that you can use. But it's way more powerful when it comes to
              application and packet analysis compared to Tcpdump. It's a
              graphical utility that also uses the libpcap library for capture
              and interpretation of packets. But it's way more extensible when
              it comes to protocol and application analysis. While Tcpdump can
              do basic analysis of some types of traffic like DNS queries and
              answers, Wireshark can do way more. Wireshark can decode encrypted
              payloads if the encryption key is known, it can identify and
              extract data payloads from file transfers through protocols like
              SMB or HTTP. Wireshark's understanding of application level
              protocols even extends to its filter strings. This allows filter
              rules like finding HTTP requests with specific strings in the URL,
              which would look like http.request.uri matches q=wireshark. That
              filter string would locate packets in our capture and that contain
              a URL request that has the specified string within it. In this
              case, it would match a query perimeter from a URL searching for
              Wireshark. While this could be done using Tcpdump, it's much
              easier using Wireshark. Let's take a quick look at the Wireshark
              interface, which is divided into thirds. The list of packets are
              up top, followed by the layered representation of a selected
              packet from the list. Lastly, the X and ascii representation of
              the selected packet are at the bottom. The packet list view is
              color-coded to distinguish between different types of traffic in
              the capture. The color-coded is user configurable. The defaults
              are green for TCP packets, light blue for UDP traffic, and dark
              blue for DNS traffic. Black also highlights problematic TCP
              packets, like out-of-order or repeated packets. Above the packet
              list pane is a display filter box which allows complex filtration
              of packets to be shown. This is different from capture filters
              which follows the libpcap standard along with Tcpdump. Wireshark's
              deep understanding of protocols allows filtering by protocols
              along with their specific fields. Sensor over 2,000 protocols
              supported by Wireshark. We won't cover them in detail. Not only
              does Wireshark have very handy protocol handling and filtration,
              it also understands and can follow TCP stream or sessions. This
              lets you quickly reassemble and view both sides of the TCP session
              so you can easily view the full two-way exchange of information
              between parties. Some other neat features of Wireshark is its
              ability to decode WPA and WEP encrypted wireless packets if the
              passphrase is known. It's also able to view Bluetooth traffic with
              the right hardware, along with USB traffic in other protocols like
              Zigbee. It also supports file carving or extracting data payloads
              from files transferred over unencrypted protocols like HTTP file
              transfers or FTP. It's able to extract audio streams from
              unencrypted VOIP traffic. So basically, Wireshark is awesome. You
              might be wondering how packet capture and analysis fits into
              security at this point. Like logs analysis, traffic analysis is
              also an important part of network security. Traffic analysis is
              done using packet captures and packet analysis. Traffic on a
              network is basically a flow of packets. Now being able to capture
              and inspect those packets is important to understanding what type
              of traffic is flowing on our networks that we'd like to protect.

              <h4>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems</h4>

              Intrusion detection and prevention systems or IDS/IPS. IDS or IPS
              systems operate by monitoring network traffic and analyzing it. As
              an IT support specialist, you may need to support the underlying
              platform that the IDS/IPS runs on. You might also need to maintain
              the system itself, ensuring that rules are updated and you may
              even need to respond to alerts. What exactly do IDS and IPS
              systems do? They look for matching behavior or characteristics
              that would indicate malicious traffic. The difference between an
              IDS and an IPS system is that IDS is only a detection system. It
              won't take action to block or prevent an attack when one is
              detected, it will only log and alert. But an IPS system can adjust
              firewall rules on the fly to block or drop the malicious traffic
              when it's detected. IPS and IDS systems can either be host-based
              or network-based. In the case of a network intrusion detection
              system or NIDS, the detection system would be deployed somewhere
              on a network where it can monitor traffic for a network segment or
              subnet. A host-based intrusion detection system would be a
              software deployed on a host that monitors traffic to and from that
              host only. It might also monitor system files for unauthorized
              changes. NID systems resemble firewalls in a lot of ways. But a
              firewall is designed to prevent intrusions by blocking potentially
              malicious traffic coming from outside and enforce Ackles between
              networks. NID systems are meant to detect and alert on potential
              malicious activity coming from within the network.
              <img src="image/5/network-host-based-id.jpeg" alt="" />
              Plus, firewalls only have visibility of traffic flowing between
              networks. They're set up to protect. They generally wouldn't have
              visibility of traffic between hosts inside the network. The
              location of the NIDS must be considered carefully When you deploy
              a system. It needs to be located in the network topology in a way
              that it has access to the traffic we'd like to monitor. A good way
              that you can get access to network traffic is using the port
              mirroring functionality found in many enterprise switches. This
              allows all packets on a port, port range or entire VLAN to be
              mirrored to another port where our NIDS hosts would be connected.
              With this configuration, our NIDS machine would be able to see all
              packets flowing in and out of hosts on the switch segment. This
              lets us monitor host-to-host communications and traffic from hosts
              to external networks like the Internet. The NIDS host would
              analyze this traffic by enabling promiscuous mode on the analysis
              port. This is the network interface that's connected to the mirror
              port on a switch. It can see all packets being passed and perform
              analysis on the traffic. Since this interface is used for
              receiving mirrored packets from the network we'd like to monitor,
              a NIDS host must have at least two network interfaces. One is for
              monitoring and analysis and a separate one is for connecting to
              our network for management and administrative purposes. Placement
              of a NIP system or network intrusion prevention system, would
              differ from a NID system. This is because of a prevention system
              being able to take action against a suspected malicious traffic.
              In order for a NIPS device to block or job traffic from a detected
              threat, it must be placed in line with the traffic being
              monitored. This means that the traffic that's being monitored must
              pass through the NIPS device. If it wasn't the case, the NIPS host
              wouldn't be able to take action on suspected traffic. Think of it
              this way. A NIDS device is a passive observer that only watches
              the traffic and sends an alert if it sees something. This is
              unlike a NIPS device, which not only monitors traffic, but can
              take action on the traffic it's monitoring usually by blocking or
              dropping the traffic. The detection of threats or malicious
              traffic is usually handled through signature-based detection.
              Similar to how antivirus software detects malware. As an IT
              support specialist, you might be in charge of maintaining the IDS
              or IPS setup, which would include ensuring that rules and
              signatures are up-to-date. Signatures are unique characteristics
              of known malicious traffic. They might be specific sequences of
              packets or packets with certain values encoded in the specific
              header field. This allows intrusion detection and prevention
              systems from easily and quickly recognizing known bad traffic from
              sources like botnets, worms, and other common attack vectors on
              the internet.
              <img src="image/5/intrusion-detection-prevention.jpeg" alt="" />
              But similar to antivirus, less common or targeted attacks might
              not be detected by a signature-based system, since there might not
              be signatures developed for these cases. It's also possible to
              create custom rules to match traffic that might be considered
              suspicious but not necessarily malicious. This would allow
              investigators to look into the traffic in more detail to determine
              the badness level. If the traffic is found to be malicious, a
              signature can be developed from the traffic and incorporated into
              the system. What actually happens when a NID system to detect
              something malicious? This is configurable, but usually the NID
              system would log the detection event along with a full packet
              capture of the malicious traffic. An alert would also usually be
              triggered to notify the investigating team to look into the
              detected traffic. Depending on the severity of the event, the
              alert may just email group or create a ticket to follow up on. Or
              it might paid someone in the middle of the night if it's
              determined to be a really high severity and urgent. These alerts
              would usually also include reference information linking to a
              known vulnerability or some more information about the nature of
              the alert to help the investigator look into the event. Well, we
              covered a lot of ground on securing your networks. I hope you feel
              secure enough to move on. If not, you can review any of these
              concepts that we've talked about. Required en ​

              <h4>Unified Threat Management (UTM)</h4>
              <p>
                Previously, you learned about several network security topics,
                including network hardening best practices, firewall essentials,
                and the foundations of IEEE 802.1X. In this reading, you will
                learn about a robust solution for network security, Unified
                Threat Management (UTM), along with its features, benefits, and
                risks.
              </p>

              <p>
                UTM solutions stretch beyond the traditional firewall to include
                an array of network security tools with a single management
                interface. UTM simplifies the configuration and enforcement of
                security controls and policies, saving time and resources.
                Security event logs and reporting are also centralized and
                simplified to provide a holistic view of network security
                events.
              </p>

              <h5>UTM options and configurations</h5>
              <p>
                UTM solutions are available with a variety of options and
                configurations to meet the network security needs of an
                organization:
              </p>
              <h6>UTM hardware and software options:</h6>

              <ul>
                <li>Stand-alone UTM network appliance</li>

                <li>Set of UTM networked appliances or devices</li>

                <li>UTM server software application(s)</li>
              </ul>

              <h6>Extent of UTM protection options:</h6>

              <ul>
                <li>Single host</li>

                <li>Entire network</li>
              </ul>

              <h6>UTM security service and tool options can include:</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Firewall: Can be the first line of defense in catching
                  phishing attacks, spam, viruses, malware, and other potential
                  threats that attempt to access an organization’s network.
                  Firewalls can be hardware devices or software applications.
                  Firewalls filter and inspect packets of data attempting to
                  enter and exit a managed network. Rules can be configured to
                  permit or prevent certain types of packets from entering the
                  network.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Intrusion detection system (IDS): Passively monitors packets
                  of data and network traffic for unusual patterns that could
                  indicate an attack. IDS devices can monitor entire networks
                  (NIDS) or just a single host (HIDS). IDS identifies, logs, and
                  alerts IT Support about suspicious traffic. However, IDS does
                  not prevent an attack from occurring. This system gives IT
                  Support professionals the opportunity to inspect flagged
                  events to determine how to handle the threat on a case by case
                  basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Intrusion prevention system (IPS): Actively monitors packets
                  and network traffic for potential malicious attacks. IPS
                  systems can be configured to automatically block attacks or to
                  allow manual interventions. IPS devices can monitor entire
                  networks (NIPS) or just a single host (HIPS).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Antivirus software: Uses a signature database to obtain the
                  profiles of malicious files, such as spyware, Trojans,
                  malware, worms, and more. The antivirus software monitors the
                  organization’s network and systems for these virus signatures.
                  Once identified, the software will block, quarantine, or
                  destroy them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Anti-malware software: Scans information streams for known
                  malicious malware signatures and blocks threats. Additionally,
                  anti-malware software can use heuristic analysis to detect
                  novel malware threats by identifying key behaviors and
                  characteristics. The software can also use sandboxing to
                  isolate suspicious files.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spam gateway: Filters, identifies, and quarantines spam email.
                  Spam gateways are network servers that use Domain Name Server
                  (DNS) management tools to protect against spam.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Web and content filters: Block user access to risky and
                  malicious websites. When a user attempts to access an
                  unauthorized or suspicious website using a browser, the UTM
                  web filter can prevent the website from loading. The filter
                  can also be customized to block certain types of websites or
                  specific URLs, like social media or other websites that might
                  be a distraction in the workplace.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Data leak/loss prevention (DLP): Monitors outgoing network
                  traffic for personal, sensitive, and confidential data. DLP
                  includes a verification system to determine if the external
                  data transfer is authorized or malicious, and can block
                  unauthorized attempts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Virtual Private Network (VPN): Encrypts data and creates a
                  private “tunnel” to safely transmit the data through a public
                  network.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Stream-based vs. proxy-based UTM inspections</h5>
              <p>
                UTM solutions offers two methods for inspecting packets in UTM
                firewalls, IPS, IDS, and VPNs:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Stream-based inspection, also called flow-based inspection:
                  UTM devices inspects data samples from packets for malicious
                  content and threats as the packets flow through the device in
                  a stream of data. This process minimizes the duration of the
                  security inspection, which keeps network data flowing at a
                  faster rate than a proxy-based inspection.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Proxy-based inspection: A UTM network appliance works as a
                  proxy server for the flow of network traffic. The UTM
                  appliance intercepts packets and uses them to reconstruct
                  files. Then the UTM device will analyze the file for threats
                  before allowing the file to continue on to its intended
                  destination. Although this security screening process is more
                  thorough than the stream-based inspection technique,
                  proxy-based inspections are slower in the transmission of
                  data.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Benefits of using UTM</h5>
              <p>
                UTM solutions can offer multiple benefits to an organization:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  UTM can be cost-effective: Reduces the time and resources
                  needed to manage multiple stand-alone security tools.
                  Purchasing a suite of integrated tools may also be less
                  expensive than buying each tool separately.
                </li>

                <li>
                  UTM is flexible and adaptable: Offers flexible solutions and
                  options for security management. The security services and
                  tools in a UTM can be implemented in any combination that is
                  appropriate for each network environment.
                </li>

                <li>
                  UTM offers integrated and centralized management: Consolidates
                  multiple security tools into a central management console.
                  This simplifies monitoring and addressing security threats, as
                  well as streamlines the management of updates to the UTM
                  components. The central management feature also helps IT
                  Support staff identify and stop the full extent of an attack
                  across an entire network.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Risks of using UTM</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  UTM can become a single point of failure in a network security
                  attack: If an attack disables an entire UTM solution, there
                  would be no other backup security services or tools to stop
                  that attack. One of the core principles of information systems
                  management is to design and implement redundant, backup, and
                  failover systems. When one element of an IT system is attacked
                  or experiences a failure, there should always be a backup or
                  parallel system to replace it.
                </li>

                <li>
                  UTM might be a waste of resources for small businesses: Small
                  businesses may not need a robust security solution like UTM.
                  The time and money needed to purchase, implement, and manage a
                  complex UTM system may not provide a significant return on
                  security benefits for a smaller network. Cybercriminals are
                  more likely to attack larger targets.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Unified Threat Management (UTM) systems offer multiple options
                  in a comprehensive suite of network security tools. UTM
                  solutions can be implemented as hardware and/or software and
                  can protect either a single host or an entire network.
                </li>

                <li>
                  UTM security services and tool options include firewalls, IDS,
                  IPS, antivirus and anti-malware software, spam gateways, web
                  and content filters, data leak/loss prevention, and VPN
                  services.
                </li>

                <li>
                  The benefits of using a UTM solution include having a
                  cost-effective network security system that is flexible and
                  adaptable with a management console that is integrated and
                  centralized. The risks of using UTM include creating a single
                  point of failure for a network security system and it might be
                  an unnecessary use of resources for small businesses.

              <h4>Home Network Security</h4>
              <p>
                Employees who work from home use home networks to access company
                files and programs. Using home networks creates security
                challenges for companies. Companies can provide employees
                guidance for protecting their home networks from attacks. This
                reading will cover common attacks on home networks and steps to
                make home networks more secure.
              </p>

              <h5>Common security vulnerabilities</h5>
              <p>
                Home networks have vulnerabilities to various types of attacks.
                The most common security attacks on home networks include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Meddler in the middle attacks allows a meddler to get between
                  two communication devices or applications. The meddler then
                  replies as the sender and receiver without either one knowing
                  they are not communicating with the correct person, device, or
                  application. These attacks allow the meddler to obtain login
                  credentials and other sensitive information.
                  <img
                    src="image/5/meddler-in-the-middle.png"
                    alt="An attacker gets between a user communicating with a website and
                then relays information as the user to the website."
                  />
                </li>

                <li>
                  Data Theft is when data within the network is stolen, copied,
                  sent, or viewed by someone who should not have access.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ransomware uses malware to keep users from accessing important
                  files on their network. Hackers grant access to the files
                  after receiving a ransom payment.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Keeping home networks secure</h5>
              <p>
                To protect company data, employees working from home need to
                take steps to improve the security of their home networks. Home
                networks can have added protection without expensive equipment
                or software.
              </p>

              <p>Employees can take steps to keep home networks more secure:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Change the default name and password using the same password
                  guidelines as your company.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Limit access to the home network by not sharing access
                  credentials outside of trusted individuals.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Create a guest network that allows guests to connect to the
                  internet but not your other devices.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Turn on WiFi network encryption requiring a password before a
                  device can access the internet.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Turn on the router’s firewall to prevent unwanted traffic from
                  entering or leaving your wireless network without your
                  knowledge. Regularly update your router firmware.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update to the newest WiFi standard which is the most secure
                  standard for home WiFi.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Another security measure that a company can take is for
                employees to work over a virtual private network, or VPN. Using
                a VPN creates an encrypted, secure internet connection through
                which employees can access company data.
              </p>

              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                Home network security is vital to protect a company’s sensitive
                information when employees work from home.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Data theft, ransomware, and meddler in the middle are common
                  attacks on home networks.
                </li>

              <h4>Intro to Defense in Depth</h4>

              Defense in depth is the concept of having multiple overlapping
              systems of defense to protect IT systems. This ensures some amount
              of redundancy for defensive measures. It also helps avoid a
              catastrophic compromise in the event that a single system fails or
              a vulnerability is discovered in one system. Think of this as
              having multiple lines of defense. If an attacker manages to bypass
              your firewall, you're still protected by strong authentication
              systems within the network. This would require an attacker to find
              more vulnerabilities in more systems before real damage can occur.
              These next lessons will focus on bringing together the different
              security systems and measures we've discussed so far into a
              comprehensive security design. It'll offer defense in depth from a
              variety of known and unknown threats. By the end of this course,
              you'll be able to implement the appropriate methods for system
              hardening and application hardening. You'll also be able to
              determine the policies to use for operating system security. All
              right, let's get started.

              <h4>Disabling Unnecessary Components</h4>
              Think back to the beginning of this course, when we talked about
              attacks and vulnerabilities. The special class of vulnerabilities
              we discussed, called zero day vulnerabilities, are unique since
              they're unknown until they're exploited in the wild. Riproduci il
              video a partire da ::15 e segui la trascrizione0:15 The potential
              for these unknown flaws is something you should think about when
              looking to secure your company's systems and networks. Even though
              it's an unknown risk, it can still be handled by taking measures
              to restrict and control access to systems. Our end goal overall is
              risk reduction. Two important terms to know when talking about
              security risks are attack vectors and attack surfaces. An attack
              vector is a method or mechanism by which an attacker or malware
              gains access to a network or system. Some attack vectors are email
              attachments, network protocols or services, network interfaces and
              user input. These are different approaches or paths that an
              attacker could use to compromise the system, if they're able to
              exploit it. And attack surface is the sum of all the different
              attack vectors in a given system. Think of this as the combination
              of all possible ways an attacker could interact with our system
              regardless of known vulnerabilities. It's not possible to know of
              all vulnerabilities in the system, so make sure to think of all
              avenues that an outside actor could interact with our systems as a
              potential attack surface. The main takeaway here is to keep our
              attack surfaces as small as possible. This reduces the chances of
              an attacker discovering an unknown flaw and compromising our
              systems. There are lots of approaches you can use as an IT support
              specialist to reduce attack surfaces, all of them boiled down to
              simplifying systems and services. The less complex something is,
              the less likely there will be undetected flaws. So make sure to
              disable any extra services or protocols, if they're not totally
              necessary, then get them out of there. Every additional surface
              that's operating represents additional attack surfaces that could
              have an undiscovered vulnerability. That vulnerability could be
              exploited and lead to compromise. This concept also applies to
              access in hackles, only allow access when totally necessary. So
              for example, it's probably not necessary for employees to be able
              to access printers directly from outside of the local network. You
              can just adjust firewall rules to prevent that type of access.
              Another way to keep things simple is to reduce your software
              deployments. Instead of having five different software solutions
              to accomplish five separate tasks, replace them with one unified
              solution, if you can. That one solution should require less
              complex code which reduces the number of potential
              vulnerabilities. You should also make sure to disable unnecessary
              or unused components of software and systems deployed. By
              disabling features not in use, you're reducing even more attack
              surfaces even more. You're not only reducing the number of ways an
              attacker can get in, but you're also minimizing the amount of code
              that's active. Riproduci il video a partire da :3:8 e segui la
              trascrizione3:08 It's important to take this approach at every
              level of systems and networks under your administration. It might
              seem obvious to take these measures on critical networking
              infrastructure and servers, but it's just as important to do this
              for desktop and laptop platforms that your employees use. Lots of
              consumer operating systems ship a bunch of default services and
              software enabled right out of the box, that you probably won't be
              using in an enterprise network or environment. For example, tell
              that access for a managed switch has no business being enabled in
              a real-world environment. You should disable it immediately if you
              find it on a device. Any vendor specific API access should also be
              disabled if you don't plan on using these services or tools. They
              might be harmless especially if you set-up strong firewall rules
              and network hackles. This one service might represent a fairly low
              risk, but why take any unnecessary risk at all? Remember, the
              defense in depth concept is all about risk mitigation and
              implementing layers of security. Now, let's think about the
              layered approach to security. What if our access control measures
              are bypassed or fail in some unforeseen way. As an IT support
              specialist, this is exactly what you want to think about. How do
              we keep this component secure if the security systems above it
              have failed?
            </div>
            <div class="article__part">
              <h4>Host-Based Firewall</h4>

              We briefly mentioned host-based firewalls when we talked about
              network monitoring and intrusion detection systems. Host-based
              firewalls are important to creating multiple layers of security.
              They protect individual hosts from being compromised when they're
              used in untrusted, and potentially malicious environments. They
              also protect individual hosts from potentially compromised peers
              inside a trusted network. Our network-based firewall has a duty to
              protect our internal network by filtering traffic in and out of
              it. While the host-based firewall on each individual host,
              protects that one machine. Like our network-based firewall, we'd
              still want to start with an implicit deny rule, then we'd
              selectively enable specific services and ports that'll be used.
              This lets us start with a secure default, and then only permits
              traffic that we know and trust. You can think of this as starting
              with a perfectly secure firewall configuration and then poking
              holes in it for the specific traffic we require. This may look
              very different from your network firewall configuration, since
              it's unlikely that your employees would need remote SSH access to
              their laptops, for example. Remember that to secure systems, you
              need to minimize attack surfaces or exposure. A host-based
              firewall plays a big part in reducing what's accessible to an
              outside attacker. It provides flexibility while only permitting
              connections to selective services on a given host from specific
              networks or IP ranges. This ability to restrict connections from
              certain origins, is usually used to implement a highly secure host
              to network. From there, access to critical or sensitive systems or
              infrastructure is permitted. These are called bastion hosts or
              networks, and are specifically hardened and minimized to reduce
              what's permitted to run on them. Bastion hosts are usually exposed
              to the Internet, so you should pay special attention to hardening
              and locking them down to reduce the chances of compromise.
              <img src="image/5/bastion-host.jpeg" alt="" />
              But they can also be used as a gateway or access portal into more
              sensitive services like core authentication servers or domain
              controllers. This would let you implement more secure
              authentication mechanisms and ACLs on the bastion hosts without
              making it inconvenient for your entire company. Monitoring and
              logging can be prioritized for these hosts more easily. Typically,
              these hosts or networks would also have severely limited network
              connectivity. It's usually just to the secure zone that they're
              designed to protect and not much else. Applications that are
              allowed to be installed and run on these hosts, would also be
              restricted to those that are strictly necessary since these
              machines have one specific purpose. Part of the host-based
              firewall rules will likely also provide ackles that allow access
              from the VPN subnet. It's good practice to keep the network that
              VPN clients connect into separate using both subnetting and VLANs.
              This gives you more flexibility to enforce security on these VPN
              clients. It also lets you build additional layers of defenses.
              While a VPN host should be protected using other means, it's still
              a host that's operating in a potentially malicious environment.
              <img src="image/5/vpn-host.jpeg" alt="" />
              This host is then initiating a remote connection into your trusted
              internal network. These hosts represent another potential vector
              of attack and compromise. Your ability to separately monitor
              traffic coming and going from them is super useful. There's an
              important thing for you to consider when it comes to host-based
              firewalls, especially for clients systems like laptops. If the
              users of the system have administrative rights than they have the
              ability to change firewall rules and configurations. This is
              something you should keep in mind and make sure to monitor with
              logging. If management tools allow it, you should also prevent the
              disabling of the host-based firewall. This can be done with
              Microsoft Windows machines when administered using Active
              Directory as an example. Required en ​

              <h4>Logging and Auditing</h4>

              A critical part of any security architecture is logging and
              alerting. It wouldn't do much good to have all these defenses in
              place. If we have no idea if they're working or not, we need
              visibility into the security systems in place to see what kind of
              traffic they're seeing. We also need to have the visibility into
              the logs of all of our infrastructure devices and equipment that
              we manage but it's not enough to just have logs. We also need ways
              to safeguard logs and make them easy to analyze and review. If
              there's a dedicated security team at your company, they would be
              performing this analysis but at a smaller company this
              responsibility would likely fall to the IT team. So let's make
              sure you're prepared with the skills you might need for incident
              investigation. Many investigative techniques can also be applied
              to troubleshooting. All systems and services running on hosts will
              create logs of some kind with different levels of detail. It
              depends on what its logging and what events it's configured to
              log. So an authentication server would log every authentication
              attempt whether it's successful or not. A firewall would log
              traffic that matches rules with details like source and
              destination addresses and ports being used. All this log
              information gives us details about the traffic and activity that's
              happening on our network and systems. This can be used to detect
              compromise or attempts to attack the system. When there are a
              large number of systems located around your network, each with
              their own log format, it can be challenging to make meaningful
              sense of all this data. This is where security information and
              event management systems or SIEMS come in. A SIEM can be thought
              of as a centralized log server it is some extra analysis features
              too. You can think of SIEM as a form of centralized logging for
              security administration purposes. A SIEM system gets logs from a
              bunch of other systems. It consolidates the logs from all
              different places and places it in one centralized location. This
              makes handling logs a lot easier. As an IT support specialist an
              important step you'll take in logs analysis is normalization. This
              is the process of taking log data in different formats and
              converting it into a standardized format that's consistent with a
              defined log structure. As an IT support specialist you might
              configure normalization for your log sources. For example, log
              entries from our firewall may have a timestamp using a year, month
              and day format. While logs from our client machines may use day,
              month, year format. To normalize this data, you choose one
              standard date format then you define what the fields are for the
              log types that need to be converted. When logs are received from
              these machines, the log entries are converted into the standard
              that we defined and stored by the logging server. This lets you
              analyze and compare log data between different log types and
              systems in a much easier fashion. So what type of information
              should you be logging? Well that's a great question. If you log
              too much info, it's difficult to analyze the data and find useful
              information plus storage requirements for saving the logs become
              expensive very quickly. But if you log too little then the
              information won't provide any useful insights into your systems
              and network. Finding that middle ground can be difficult. It will
              vary depending on the unique characteristics of the systems being
              monitored and the type of activity on the network. No matter what
              events are logged, all of them should have information that will
              help understand what happened and reconstruct the events. There
              are lots of important fields to capture and log entries like
              timestamp, the event or error code, the service or application
              being logged. The user or system account associated with the event
              and the devices involved in the event. Timestamps are super
              important to understanding when an event occurred. Fields like
              source and destination addresses will tell us who was talking to
              whom. For application logs you can grab useful information from
              the logged in user associated with the event and from what client
              they used. On top of the analysis assistance it provides a
              centralized log server also has security benefits. By maintaining
              logs on a dedicated system, it's easier to secure the system from
              attack. Logs are usually targeted by attackers after a breach so
              that they can cover their tracks. By having critical systems send
              logs to remote logging server that's locked down, the details of a
              breach should still be logged. A forensics team will be able to
              reconstruct the events that led to the compromise. Once we have
              logging configured and the relevant events recorded on a
              centralized log server, what do we do with all the data while
              analyzing log details depends on what you're trying to achieve.
              Typically when you look at aggregated logs as an IT support
              specialist, you should pay attention to patterns and connections
              between traffic. So if you're seeing a large percentage of Windows
              hosts, all connecting to specific address outside your network
              that might be worth investigating, it could signal a malware
              infection. Once logs are centralized and standardized you can
              write automated alerting based on rules. Maybe you'll want to
              define an alert rule for repeated unsuccessful attempts to
              authenticate to a critical authentication server. Lots of SIEM
              solutions also offer handy dashboards to help analysts visualize
              this data. Having data in a visual format can potentially provide
              more insight. You can also write some of your own monitoring and
              alert systems. Now it doesn't matter if you're using a SIEM
              solution or writing your own. It can be useful to break down
              things like commonly used protocols in the network. Quickly see
              the top talkers in the network and view reported errors over time
              to reveal patterns. Another important component to logging to keep
              in mind as an IT support specialist is retention. Your log storage
              needs will vary based on the amount of systems being logged. The
              amount of detail logs and the rate at which logs are created, how
              long you want or need to keep logs around will also really
              influence the storage requirements for a log server. Some examples
              of logging servers and SIEM solutions are the open source,
              rsyslog, Splunk Enterprise Security, IBM Security Qradar and RSA
              Security Analytics.

              <h4>Antimalware Protection</h4>

              Anti malware defenses are a core part of any company's security
              model in this day and age. So, it's important as an IT support
              specialist to know what's out there. Today, the Internet is full
              of bots, viruses, worms and other automated attacks. Lots of
              unprotected systems would be compromised in a matter of minutes if
              directly connected to the Internet without any safeguards or
              protections in place. And they need to have critical system
              updates. While modern operating systems have reduced this threat
              vector by having basic firewalls enabled by default, there's still
              a huge amount of attack traffic on the Internet. Anti malware
              measures play a super important role in keeping this type of
              attack off your systems and helping to protect your users.
              Antivirus software has been around for a really long time. But
              some security experts question the value it can provide to a
              company, especially since more sophisticated malware and attacks
              have been spun up in recent years. Antivirus software is
              signature-based. This means that it has a database of signatures
              that identify known malware like the unique file hash of a
              malicious binary or the file associated with an infection. Or it
              could be the network traffic characteristics that malware uses to
              communicate with a command and control server. Antivirus software
              will monitor and analyze things like new files being created or
              being modified on the system in order to watch for any behavior
              that matches a known malware signature. If it detects activity
              that matches the signature, depending on the signature type, it
              will attempt to block the malware from harming the system. But
              some signatures might only be able to detect the malware after the
              infection has occurred. In that case, it may attempt to quarantine
              the infected files. If that's not possible, it'll just log and
              alert the detection event at a high level. This is how all
              antivirus products work. There are two issues with antivirus
              software though. The first is that they depend on antivirus
              signatures distributed by the antivirus software vendor. The
              second is that they depend on the antivirus vendor discovering new
              malware and writing new signatures for newly discovered threats.
              Until the vendor is able to write new signatures and publish and
              disseminate them, your antivirus software can't protect you from
              these emerging threats boo. Antivirus which is designed to protect
              systems, actually represents an additional attack surface that
              attackers can exploit. You might be thinking, wait, our own
              antivirus tools can be another threat to our system. What's the
              deal with that? Well, this is because of the very nature of one
              antivirus engine must do. It takes arbitrary and potentially
              malicious binaries as input and performs various operations on
              them. Because of this, there are a lot of complex code where very
              serious bugs could exist. Exactly, this kind of vulnerability was
              found in the sofas antivirus engine back in 2012. So, it sounds
              like antivirus software is an ideal and has some pretty large
              drawbacks. Then why are we still recommending it as a core piece
              of security design? The short answer is this, it protects against
              the most common attacks out there on the Internet. The really
              obvious stuff that still poses a threat to your systems still
              needs to be defended against. Antivirus is an easy solution to
              provide that protection. It doesn't matter how much user education
              you instill in your employees, there will still be some folks who
              will click on an email that has an infected attachment. A good way
              to think about antivirus in today's very noisy external threat
              environment, is like a filter for the attack noise on the internet
              today. It lets you remove the background noise and focus on the
              more important targeted or specific threats. Remember, our defense
              and depth concept involves multiple layers of protection.
              Antivirus software is just one piece of our anti malware defenses.
              If antivirus can't protect us from the threats we don't know
              about, how do we protect against the unknown that's out there?
              Well, anti virus operates on a blacklist model, checking against a
              list of known bad things and blocking what gets matched. There's a
              class of anti malware software that does the opposite. Binary
              whitelisting software operates off a white list. It's a list of
              known good and trusted software and only things that are on the
              list are permitted to run. Everything else is blocked. You can
              think of this as applying the implicit denial tackle rule to
              software execution. By default, everything is blocked. Only things
              explicitly allowed to execute are able to. I should call out that
              this typically only applies to executable binaries, not arbitrary
              files like pdf documents or text files. This would naturally
              defend against any unknown threats but at the cost of convenience.
              Think about how frequently you download and install new software
              on your machine. Now, imagine if you had to get approval before
              you could download and install any new software, that would be
              really annoying, don't you think? Now, imagine that every system
              update had to be white listed before it could be applied.
              Obviously, not trusting everything wouldn't be very sustainable.
              It's for this reason that binary whitelisting software can trust
              software using a couple different mechanisms. The first is using
              the unique cryptographic hash of binaries which are used to
              identify unique binaries. This is used to whitelist individual
              executables. The other trust mechanism is a software signing
              certificate. Remember back when we discussed public key
              cryptography and signatures using public and private key pairs,
              software signing or code signing is the same idea but applied to
              software. A software vendor can cryptographically sign binaries
              they distribute using a private key. The signature can be verified
              at execution time by checking the signature using the public key
              embedded in the certificate and verifying the trust chain of the
              public key.
              <img src="image/5/signing-certificate.jpeg" alt="" />
              If the hash matches and the public key is trusted, then the
              software can be verified that it came from someone with the
              software vendors code signing private key. Binary whitelisting
              systems can be configured to trust specific vendors code signing
              certificates. They permit all binary signed with that certificate
              to run. This is helpful for automatically trusting content, like
              system updates along with software and common use that comes from
              reputable and trusted vendors. But can you guess the downside
              here? Each new code signing certificate that's trusted represents
              an increase in attack surface. An attacker could compromise the
              code signing certificate of a software vendor that your company
              trusts. And use that to sign malware that targets your company.
              That would bypass any binary whitelisting defenses in place. Not
              good. This exact scenario happened back in 2013, to Bit9. A binary
              whitelisting software company. Hackers managed to breach their
              internal network and found an unsecured virtual machine. It had a
              copy of the code signing certificates private key. They stole that
              key and used it to sign malware that would have been trusted by
              all Bit9 software installations by default.

              <h4>Disk Encryption</h4>

              We briefly discussed disk encryption earlier when we talked about
              encryption at a high level. Now it's time to dive deeper. Full
              disk encryption or FDE is an important factor in a defense in
              depth security model. It provides protection from some physical
              forms of attack. As an IT Support specialist, you likely assist
              with implementing an FDE solution if one doesn't exist already.
              Help with migrating between FDE solutions and troubleshoot issues
              with FDE systems like helping with forgotten passwords, so FDE is
              key. Systems with their entire hard drive's encrypted are
              resilient against data theft. They'll prevent an attacker from
              stealing potentially confidential information from a hard drive
              that's been stolen or lost. Without also knowing the encryption
              password or having access to the encryption key the data on the
              hard drive is just meaningless gibberish.
              <img src="image/5/disk-encryption.jpeg" alt="" />
              This is a very important security mechanism to deploy for more
              mobile devices like laptops, cell phones and tablets. But it's
              also recommended for desktops and servers to since disk encryption
              not only provides confidentiality but also integrity. This means
              that an attacker with physical access to a system can't replace
              system files with malicious ones or install malware. Having the
              disk fully encrypted protects from data theft and unauthorized
              tampering even if an attacker has physical access to the disk.
              Riproduci il video a partire da :1:26 e segui la trascrizione1:26
              But in order for a system to boot if it has an FDE set up, there
              are some critical files that must be accessible. They need to be
              available before the primary disk can be unlocked and the boot
              process can continue. Because of this all FDE setups have an
              unencrypted partition on the disk which holds these critical boot
              files. Examples include things like the kernel and bootloader that
              are critical to booting the operating system. These files are
              actually vulnerable to being replaced with modified potentially
              malicious files by an attacker with physical access. While it's
              possible to compromise a machine this way it would take a
              sophisticated and determined attacker to do it. There's also
              protection against this attack in the form of the secure boot
              protocol which is part of the UEFI specifications. Secure boot
              uses public key cryptography to secure these encrypted elements of
              the boot process. It does this by integrated code signing and
              verification of the boot files. Initially secure boot is
              configured with what's called a platform key, which is the public
              key corresponding to the private key used to sign the boot files.
              This platform key is written to firmware and is used at boot time
              to verify the signature of the boot files. Only files correctly
              signed and trusted will be allowed to execute. This way a secure
              boot protects against physical tampering with the unencrypted boot
              partition. There are first party full disk encryption solutions
              from Microsoft and Apple called bit locker and file vault two
              respectively. There are also a bunch of third party and open
              source solutions. On Linux the DM crypt package is super popular.
              There are also solutions from PGP, true crypt, file crypt and lots
              of others. Full disk encryption schemes rely on a secret key for
              actual encryption and decryption operations. They typically
              password protect access to this key and in some cases the actual
              encryption key is used to derive a user key which is then used to
              encrypt the master key.
              <img src="image/5/encryption-key.jpeg" alt="" />
              If the encryption key needs to be changed, the user key can be
              swapped out without requiring a full decryption and re-encryption
              of the data being protected. This would be necessary if the master
              encryption key needs to be changed. Password protecting the key
              works by requiring the user entry pass phrase to unlock the
              encryption key. It can then be used to access the protected
              contents on the disk. In many cases this might be the same as the
              user account password to keep things simple and to reduce the
              number of passwords to memorize. When you implement a full disk
              encryption solution at scale, it's super important to think about
              how to handle cases where passwords are forgotten. This is another
              convenience tradeoff when using FDE. If the pass phrases forgotten
              then the contents of the disk aren't recoverable, yikes. This is
              why lots of enterprise disk encryption solutions have a key escrow
              functionality. Key escrow allows the encryption key to be securely
              stored for later retrieval by an authorized party. So if someone
              forgets the pass phrase to unlock their encrypted disk for their
              laptop the systems administrators are able to retrieve the escrow
              key or recovery pass phrase to unlock the disk. It's usually a
              separate key or pass phrase that can unlock the disk in addition
              to the user defined one. This allows for recovery if a password is
              forgotten. The recovery key is used to unlock the disk and boot
              the system fully. You should compare full disk encryption against
              file based encryption. That's where only some files or folders are
              encrypted and not the entire disk. This is usually implemented as
              home directory encryption. It serves a slightly different purpose
              compared to FDE. Home directory or file based encryption only
              guarantees confidentiality and integrity of files protected by
              encryption. These setups usually don't encrypt system files
              because there are often compromises between security and
              usability. When the whole disk isn't encrypted, it's possible to
              remotely reboot a machine without being locked out. If you reboot
              a full disk encrypted machine, the disk unlock password must be
              entered before the machine finishes booting and is reachable over
              the network again. So while file based encryption is a little more
              convenient, it's less protected against physical attacks. An
              attacker could modify or replace core system files and compromise
              the machine to gain access to the encrypted data. This is a good
              example of why understanding threats and the risks these threats
              represent is an important part in designing a security
              architecture and choosing the right defenses. In our next lesson
              we'll cover application hardening. I'll see you there.

              <h4>Software Patch Management</h4>

              While some parts of software features are exposed, a lot of
              attacks depend on exploiting bugs and software. This triggers
              obscure and unintended behavior, which can lead to a compromise of
              the system running the vulnerable software. These types of
              vulnerabilities can be fixed through software patches and updates
              which correct the bugs that the attackers exploit. As an IT
              support specialist, it's critical that you make sure that you
              install software updates and security patches in a timely way in
              order to defend your company's systems and networks. Riproduci il

              updates don't just improve software products by adding new
              features and improving performance, and stability. They also
              address security vulnerabilities. There are some software bugs
              that are present in the core functionality of the software in
              question. This means that the vulnerability can't be mitigated by
              disabling the vulnerable service, not good. An example of this was
              the heartbleed vulnerability. A bug in the open source TLS
              library, open SSL. This was discovered and widely publicized in
              April of 2014. The bug showed up in how the library handled TLS
              heartbeat messages. Their special messages that allow one party in
              the TLS session to signal to the other party that they like the
              session to be kept alive. This works by sending a TLS heartbeat
              request message, a packet that has a text string and the length of
              the string. The receiving end is supposed to reply with the same
              text string in response. So if the heartbeat request message
              contains the text, I'm still alive and the length of 15, the
              receiving end would reply back with the same text, I am still
              alive. But the bug in the open SSL library was that the replying
              side would allocate memory space according to the value in the
              received packet. This was based on the specified length of the
              string like it's defined in the packet, not based on the actual
              length of the string. The value was not verified. This meant that
              an attacker could send a malformed heartbeat request message with
              a much larger length specified than what was allowed. The reply
              would contain the original text message, but would also include
              bits of memory from the replying system. So an attacker could send
              a malformed heartbeat request message containing the text I'm
              still alive, but with a length of 500 because the length value
              wasn't verified. This means that the response back would be I'm
              still alive followed by the next 485 characters in memory. So it
              was possible for an attacker to read up to 64 kilobytes of a
              target's memory. This memory was likely used before by open SSL
              library, so it might contain sensitive information regarding other
              TLS sessions. This bug meant that it was feasible for an attacker
              to recover the private keys used to protect TLS sessions, this
              would allow them to decrypt TLS protected sessions and recover
              details like login credentials. This is a great example of a
              mistake in the code leading to a very high profile software
              vulnerability. It could only be fixed or a software update or
              switching to a different TLS library entirely. While the heartbeat
              functionality is enabled by default, it's possible to disable it
              in the open SSL library, but it wasn't a simple argument to pass
              to an application. Disabling this functionality required compiling
              the library with a flag that was specified to disable heartbeats,
              then you had to replace the installed version with the custom
              compiled one. That's not something most people will do. This was
              also a library wildly used by both server applications and client
              applications. This means that it might not be possible to replace
              the open SSL library with a customized version or a different
              library. The only way to address the vulnerability and client
              software that implemented open SSL was to wait for a patch from
              the software vendor, what a mess? Here's the bad news. With
              software continuing to grow more complex over time, these types of
              bugs are likely to become more commonplace. Attackers will be
              looking for exactly this type of vulnerability. The best
              protection is to have a good system and policy in place for your
              company. The system should be checking for, distributing and
              verifying software updates for software deployment. This is a
              complex problem when considering a large organization with many
              machines to manage that run a variety of software products. This
              is where management tools can help make this task more
              approachable for you. Solutions like Microsoft SCCM or Puppet
              labs, Puppet and factor tools allow administrators to get an
              overview of what software is installed across their fleet of
              managed systems. This lets the security team analyze what specific
              software and versions are installed to better understand the risk
              of vulnerable software in the fleet. When updates are released and
              pushed to the fleet, these reporting tools can help make sure that
              the updates have been applied. SCCM, even has the ability to force
              install updates after a specified deadline has passed. Patching
              isn't just necessary for software, but also operating systems and
              firmware that run on infrastructure devices. Every device has code
              running on it that might have software bugs that could lead to
              security vulnerabilities from routers, switches, phones, even
              printers. Operating system vendors usually push security related
              patches pretty quickly when an issue is discovered. They'll
              usually release security fixes out of cycle from typical OS
              upgrades to ensure a timely fix, because of the security
              implications. But for embedded devices like network and equipment
              or printers, this might not be typical. Critical infrastructure
              devices should be approached carefully when you apply updates.
              There's always the risk that a software update will introduce a
              new bug that might affect the functionality of the device or if
              the update process itself would go wrong and cause an outage. I
              hope you can see the importance of applying software patches and
              firmware updates in a timely fashion. It would be pretty
              embarrassing if you wind up being compromised by a vulnerability
              that could have been easily fixed with a software update.

              <h4>Browser Hardening</h4>
              <p>
                In this reading, you will learn how to harden browsers for
                enhanced internet security. The methods presented include
                evaluating sources for trustworthiness, SSL certificates,
                password managers, and browser security best practices.
                Techniques for browser hardening are important components in
                enterprise-level IT security policies. These techniques can also
                be used to improve internet security for organizations of any
                size and for individual users.

              <h5>Identifying trusted versus untrusted sources</h5>
              <p>
                Some cybercriminals monitor SEO search terms for popular
                software downloads. Then they create fake websites to pose as
                hosts for these popular downloads. They might even use
                advertising and stolen logos of trusted companies to make the
                sites appear to be legitimate businesses. However, the
                downloadable files available on the cybercriminals’ websites are
                usually malicious software. Unaware of the deception, users
                download and install the malware. In some cases, the users don’t
                even need to download a file. Savvy cybercriminals can design
                web pages that have the ability to infect users’ devices simply
                upon visiting the sites.
              </p>

              <p>
                To guard against threats like this, there are checks you can
                perform to evaluate websites:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Use antivirus and anti-malware software and browser
                  extensions. Run antivirus and anti-malware scans regularly and
                  scan downloaded files. Ensure antivirus and anti-malware
                  browser extensions are enabled when surfing the web.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Check for SSL certificates. See the “Secure connections and
                  sites” section below.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Ensure the URL displayed in the address bar shows the correct
                  domain name. For example, Google websites use the Google.com
                  domain name.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Search for negative reviews of the website from trusted
                  sources. Be wary of websites that have few to no reviews. They
                  may not have been active long enough to build a bad
                  reputation. Cybercriminals will create new websites when they
                  get too many negative reviews on their older sites.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Don’t automatically trust website links provided by people or
                  organizations you trust. They may not be aware that they are
                  passing along links to malicious websites and files.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Use hashing algorithms for downloaded files. Compare the
                  developer-provided hash value of the original file to the hash
                  value of the downloaded copy to ensure the two values match.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Secure connections and sites</h6>
              <p>
                Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates are issued by trusted
                certificate authorities (CA), such as DigiCert. An SSL
                certificate indicates that any data submitted through a website
                will be encrypted. A website with a valid SSL certificate has
                been inspected and verified by the CA. You can find SSL
                certificates by performing the following steps:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Check the URL in the address bar. The URL should begin with
                  the https:// protocol. If you see http:// without the “s”,
                  then the website is not secure.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Click on the closed padlock icon in the address bar to the
                  left of the URL. An open lock indicates that the website is
                  not secure.
                </li>

                <li>
                  A pop-up menu should open. Websites with SSL certificates will
                  have a menu option labeled “Connection is secure.” Click on
                  this menu item.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                      A new pop-up menu will appear with a link to check the
                      certificate information. The layout and wording of this
                      pop-up will vary depending on which browser you are using.
                      When you review the certificate, look for the following
                      items:4
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The name of the issuer - Make sure it is a trusted
                      certificate authority.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      The domain it was issued to - This name should match the
                      website domain name.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>

                The expiration date - The certificate should not have passed its
                expiration date.
              </ol>
              <p>
                Note that cybercriminals can obtain SSL certificates too. So,
                this is not a guarantee that the site is safe. CAs also vary in
                how thorough they are in their inspections.
              </p>

              <h5>Password managers</h5>
              <p>
                Password managers are software programs that encrypt and retain
                passwords in secure cloud storage or locally on users’ personal
                computing devices. There are a wide variety of activities users
                perform online that require unique and complex passwords, such
                as banking, managing health records, filing taxes, and more. It
                can be difficult for users to keep track of so many different
                logins and passwords. Fortunately, password managers can help.

              <h4>Application Policies</h4>

              As you can see, application software can represent a pretty large
              attack surface. This is especially true when it comes to a large
              fleet of systems used throughout an organization. It's important
              to have some kind of application policies in place. These policies
              serve two purposes. Not only do they define boundaries of what
              applications are permitted or not, but they also help educate
              folks on how to use software more securely. We've seen the risks
              that software can pose because of security vulnerabilities. It
              makes sense to have a policy around applying software updates in a
              timely way. Common recommendation or even a requirement is to only
              support or require the latest version of a piece of software. From
              the IT support perspective, this is important because software
              updates were often fix issues that someone may be encountering.
              But from the security side of things, making sure the latest
              version of the software will ensure that all security patches have
              been applied, and the most secure version is in use. This should
              be clearly called out in a policy. People tend to be pretty lazy
              about applying updates to software that they use a lot. Lots of
              times, applying an update requires restarting the application,
              which can feel inconvenient and disruptive to users. It's
              generally a good idea to disallow risky classes of software by
              policy. Things like file-sharing software and piracy-related
              software tend to be closely associated with malware infections.
              They usually don't have a business use either. Let's not even talk
              about the legal implications of this type of software.
              Understanding what your users need to do their jobs will help
              shape your approach to software policies and guidelines. If
              there's a common use case for a certain type of software, it would
              be helpful to select a specific software implementation and
              require the use of that solution. This led to evaluate the most
              secure solution, and benefit from a more uniform software
              installation. Remember, the name of the game is to minimize attack
              surfaces. Each piece of software that accomplishes the same thing
              represents a different set of potential attack surfaces that could
              have a vulnerability lurking inside. Helping your users accomplish
              tasks by recommending or supporting specific software makes for a
              more secure environment. It also helps users by giving them clear
              solutions to accomplish tasks. If you want to employ a binary
              whitelisting solution, it's also important to define a policy
              around what type of software can be whitelisted. It's probably
              unnecessary to have video games whitelisted unless your company is
              a video game studio, of course. These policies usually require
              some business use case or justification to avoid a lot of one-off
              personal software requests. Another class of software that you
              might want to have policies defined for are browser extensions or
              add-ons. Since a lot of workflows live exclusively within the web
              browser now, they represent a potential vector for malware that
              often gets overlooked. Extensions that require full access to
              websites visited can be risky, since the extension developer has
              the power to modify pages visited. Some extensions may even send
              user input to a remote server. This could potentially leak
              confidential information. Clearly defining classifications of
              risky extensions and add-ons will help protect your systems and
              provide guidance to your users. But policies are usually not
              enough to arm users with the information they need to make
              informed choices. Their decisions can impact the security of your
              organization. That's where education and training comes into play.
              We went over a lot of really dense information on security in
              these lessons. Take time to review some of the videos so that it
              really sinks in.

              <h4>Security Goals</h4>

              If you're responsible for an organization of users, there's a
              delicate balance between security and user productivity. We've
              seen this balance in action when we dove into the different
              security tools and systems together. Before you start to design a
              security architecture, you need to define exactly what you'd like
              it to accomplish. This will depend on what your company thinks is
              most important. It will probably have a way it wants different
              data to be handled and stored. You also need to know if your
              company has any legal requirements when it comes to security. If
              your company handles credit card payments, then you have to follow
              the PCI DSS, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
              depending on local laws. We'll take a closer look at PCI DSS,
              which is a great example of clearly defined security goals. PCI
              DSS is broken into six broad objectives, each with some
              requirements. The first objective is to build and maintain a
              secure network and systems. This includes the requirements to
              install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect
              cardholder data, and to not use vendor supplied defaults for
              system passwords and other security parameters. As you can tell,
              the requirements are related to the objective. The objective is
              the end goal for what we'd like to achieve. Requirements are the
              actions that can help achieve that goal. PCI DSS goes into more
              detailed actions for each requirement. It provides more specific
              guidance around what a firewall configuration should control. For
              example, a secure firewall configuration should restrict
              connections between untrusted networks and any systems in the
              cardholder data environment. That's a little generic, but it does
              give us some guidance on how to meet the requirements. The second
              objective category is to protect cardholder data. In this
              objective, the first requirement is to protect stored cardholder
              data. The second is to encrypt the transmission of cardholder data
              across open public networks. I want to call out again how the
              broad objective is to protect sensitive data that's stored in
              systems within our control. The requirements give us specific
              guidelines on how to get this done. The specifics of these
              requirements help clarify some of the points, like what
              constitutes an open network. They also recommend using strong
              cryptography and offer some examples. But not all requirements are
              technical in nature. Let's look at the requirement to protect
              stored cardholder data, for example. it has requirements for data
              retention policies to make sure that sensitive payment information
              isn't stored beyond the time it's required. Once payment is
              authorized, authentication data shouldn't be needed anymore and it
              should be securely deleted. This highlights the fact that good
              security defenses aren't just technical in nature. They are also
              procedural and policy-based. The third objective is to maintain a
              vulnerability management program. The first requirement is to
              protect all systems against malware and regularly update antivirus
              software or programs. The second is to develop and maintain secure
              systems and applications. You'll find more detailed implementation
              procedures within these requirements. They'll cover things like
              ensuring all systems have anti-virus software installed and making
              sure the software is kept up-to-date. They also require that scans
              are run regularly and logs are maintained. There are also
              requirements for ensuring systems and software are protected
              against known vulnerabilities by applying security patches at
              least one month from the release of a security patch. Use of
              third-party security vulnerability databases is also listed to
              help identify known vulnerabilities within managed systems. The
              fourth objective is to implement strong access control measures.
              This objective has three requirements. The first is to restrict
              access to cardholder data by business need to know. The second is
              to identify and authenticate access to system components. The
              third is to restrict physical access to cardholder data. This
              highlights the importance of good access control measures along
              with good data access policies. The first objective, restricting
              access to data by business need to know, means that any sensitive
              data should be directed to data access policies to make sure that
              customer data isn't misused. Part of this requirement is to
              enforce password authentication for system access and two-factor
              authentication for remote access. That's the minimum requirement.
              Another important piece highlighted by the PCI DSS requirements is
              access control for physical access. This is a critical security
              aspect to keep in mind since we need to protect systems and data
              from both physical theft and virtual attacks. The fifth objective
              is to regularly monitor and test networks. The first requirement
              is to track and monitor all access to network resources and
              cardholder data. The second is to regularly test security systems
              and processes. The requirement for network monitoring and testing
              is another essential part of a good security plan. This refers to
              things like setting up and configuring intrusion detection systems
              and conducting vulnerability scans of the network, which we'll
              cover a bit more later. Testing defenses is another super
              important part of this. Just having the systems in place isn't
              enough. It's really helpful to test defense systems regularly to
              make sure that they provide the protection that you want. It also
              ensures that the alerting systems are functional. The sixth and
              final objective is to maintain an information security policy. It
              only has one requirement to maintain a policy that addresses
              information security for all personnel. This requirement addresses
              why we need to have well-established security policies. They help
              govern and regulate user behavior when it comes to information
              security aspects. It's important to call out that this requirement
              mentions that the policies should be for all personnel. The
              responsibility of information security isn't only on the security
              teams. Every member of an organization is responsible for
              information security. Well-designed security policies address the
              most common questions or use cases that users would have based on
              the specific details of the organization. Everyone that uses
              systems on your organization's network is able to get around
              security. They might not mean to, but they can reduce the overall
              security with their actions and practices. That's why having
              well-thought-out security policies in place also need to be easy
              to find and easy to read.

              <h4>Measuring and Assessing Risk</h4>

              Security is all about determining risks or exposure, understanding
              the likelihood of attacks, and designing defenses around these
              risks to minimize the impact of an attack. This thought process is
              actually something that everyone uses in their daily life whether
              they know it or not. Think of when you cross a busy intersection,
              you assess the probability of being hit by an oncoming car and
              minimize that risk by choosing the right time to cross the road.
              Security risk assessment starts with threat modeling. First, we
              identify likely threats to our systems, then we assign them
              priorities that correspond to severity and probability. We do this
              by brainstorming from the perspective of an outside attacker,
              putting ourselves in a hacker shoes. It helps to start by figuring
              out what high-value targets an attacker may want to go after. From
              there, you can start to look at possible attack vectors that could
              be used to gain access to high-value assets. High-value data
              usually includes account information like usernames and passwords.
              Typically, any kind of user data is considered high-value,
              especially if payment processing is involved. Another part of risk
              measurement is understanding what vulnerabilities are on your
              systems and network. One way to find these out is to perform
              regular vulnerability scanning. There are lots of open-source and
              commercial solutions that you can use. They can be configured to
              perform scheduled automated scans of designated systems or
              networks to look for vulnerabilities, then they generate a report.
              Some of these tools are Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys. Let me break
              down what vulnerability scanners do. Heads-up. This might be a
              little dense, so feel free to go over it again. Vulnerability
              scanners are services that run on your system within your control
              that conduct periodic scans of configured networks. The service
              then conducts scans to find and discover hosts on the network.

              <img src="image/5/vulnerability-scanning.jpeg" alt="" />
              Once hosts are found, either through a ping sweep or port
              scanning, more detailed scans are run against discovered hosts.
              Scans upon scans upon scans. A port scan of either common ports or
              all possible valid ports is conducted against discovered hosts to
              determine what services are listening. These services are then
              probed to try to discover more info about the type of service and
              what version is listening on the relevant port. This information
              can then be checked against databases of known vulnerabilities. If
              a vulnerable version of a service is discovered, the scanner will
              add it to its report. Once the scan is finished, the discovered
              vulnerabilities and hosts are compiled in a report. That way an
              analyst can quickly and easily see where the problem areas are on
              the network. Found vulnerabilities are prioritized according to
              severity and other categorization. Severity takes into account a
              number of things like how likely the vulnerability is to be
              exploited. It also considers the type of access the vulnerability
              would provide to an attacker and whether or not it can be
              exploited remotely or not. Vulnerabilities and the report will
              have links too detailed and disclose information about the
              vulnerability. In some cases, it will also have recommendations on
              how to get rid of it. Vulnerability scanners will detect lots of
              things ranging from misconfigured services that represent
              potential risks, to detecting the presence of backdoors in
              systems. It's important to call out that vulnerability scanning
              can only detect known and disclosed vulnerabilities and insecure
              configurations. That's why it's important for you to have an
              automated vulnerability scan conducted regularly. You'll also need
              to keep the vulnerability database up-to-date to make sure new
              vulnerabilities are detected quickly. But vulnerability scanning
              isn't the only way to put your defenses to the test. Conducting
              regular penetration tests is also really encouraged to test your
              defenses even more. These tests will also ensure detection and
              alerting systems are working properly. Penetration testing is the
              practice of attempting to break into a system or network to verify
              the systems in place. Think of this as playing the role of a bad
              guy for educational purposes. This exercise isn't designed to see
              if you have the acting chops. It's intended to make you think like
              an attacker and use the same tools and techniques they would use.
              This way you can test your systems to make sure they protect you
              like they're supposed to. The results of the penetration testing
              reports will also show you where weak points or blind spots exist.
              These tests help improve defenses and guide future security
              projects. They can be conducted by members of your in-house
              security team. If your internal team doesn't have the resources
              for this exercise, you can hire a third-party company that offers
              penetration testing as a service. You can even do both. That would
              help give you more perspectives on your defense systems and you'll
              get a more comprehensive test this way. Required en ​

              <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>

              When you're supporting systems that handle customer data, it's
              super-important to protect it from unauthorized and inappropriate
              access. It's not to defend against external threats. It also
              protects the data against misuse by employees. This type of
              behavior would fall under your company's privacy policies. Privacy
              policies oversee the access and use of sensitive data. They also
              define what appropriate and authorized use is and what provisions
              or restrictions are in place when it comes to how the data is
              used. Keep in mind that people might not consider the security
              implications of their actions. Both privacy and data access
              policies are important to guiding and informing people how to
              maintain security while handling sensitive data. Having defined in
              well-established privacy policies is an important part of good
              privacy practices. But you also need a way to enforce these
              policies. Periodic audits on cases where sensitive data was
              accessed can get you there. This was enabled by our logging and
              monitoring systems. Auditing data access logs is super important.
              It helps us ensure that sensitive data is only accessed by people
              who are authorized to access it and that they use it for the right
              reasons. It's good practice to apply the principle of least
              privilege here. By not allowing access to this type of data by
              default, you should require anyone that needs access to first make
              an access request with a justification for getting the data. But
              it can't be vague or a generic requests for access. They should be
              required to specify what data they need access to. Usually, this
              type of requests would also have a time limit that should be
              called out in the request. That way, you can ensure that data
              access is only permitted for legitimate business reasons, which
              reduces the likelihood of inappropriate data access or usage by
              logging each data access request, an actual data access. We can
              also correlate requests with usage. Any access that doesn't have a
              corresponding request should be flagged as a high priority
              potential breach that needs to be investigated as soon as
              possible. Company policies act as our guidelines and informational
              resources on how and how not to access and handle data. They're
              equally important here. Policies will range from sensitive data
              handling to public communications. Data handling policies should
              cover the details of how different data is classified. What makes
              some data sensitive as opposed to non-sensitive? What's considered
              confidential data? Well, once different data classes are defined,
              you should create guidelines around how to handle these different
              types of data. If something is considered sensitive or
              confidential, you'd probably have stipulations that this data
              shouldn't be stored on media that's easily lost or stolen, like
              USB sticks or portable hard drives. There are also commonly used
              without any encryption at all. Imagine if one of your employees
              lost an unencrypted portable hard drive full of customer
              information, disaster. That's exactly the situation a data access
              policy tries to avoid. It might also make sense to include laptops
              and mobile devices, like phones and tablets in the removable media
              classification. Since these devices are easily lost or stolen,
              even though they're more commonly encrypted these days, the loss
              and theft rate is much higher. You may not like users storing
              sensitive data on removable media, but sometimes you're out of
              luck. There may be an occasion where that's the only solution to
              accomplish a task. If this is the case, it would help to have
              recommendations on how to handle the situation in a secure way.
              You could offer an appropriate encryption solution and provide
              instructions and support on its use.

              <h4>Data Destruction</h4>
              <p>
                Data destruction is removing or destroying data stored on
                electronic devices so that an operating system or application
                cannot read it. Data destruction is required when a company no
                longer needs a device, when there are unused or multiple copies
                of data, or you are required to destroy specific data.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are three categories of data destruction methods:
                recycling, physical destruction, and third-party destruction.
                This reading will introduce the data destruction methods and how
                to decide which method to use.
              </p>

              <h5>Recycling</h5>
              <p>
                Recycling includes methods that allow for device reuse after
                data destruction. This option is recommended if you hope to
                reuse devices internally, sell surplus equipment, or your
                devices are on loan and are due to be returned. Standard
                recycling methods include the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Erasing/wiping: cleans all data off a device’s hard drive by
                  overwriting it. Erasing or wiping data can be done manually or
                  with data-destruction software. This method is practical when
                  you only have a few devices that need data destroyed, as it
                  takes a long time. Note that it may take multiple passes to
                  wipe highly sensitive data completely.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Low-level formatting: erases all data written on the hard
                  drive by replacing it with zeros. Low-level reformatting can
                  be done using a tool such as HDDGURU on a PC or the Disk
                  Utility function on a Mac.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Standard formatting: erases the path to the data and not the
                  data itself. Both PCs and Macs have internal tools that can
                  perform a standard format, Disk Management on a PC or Disk
                  Utility on a Mac. Note that standard formatting does not
                  remove the data from the device, enabling data rediscovery
                  using software.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Physical destruction</h5>
              <p>
                Physical destruction includes any method that physically
                destroys a device to make it difficult to retrieve data from it.
                You should only use physical destruction if you do not need to
                reuse the device. However, only completely destroying the device
                ensures the destruction of all data with physical methods.
                Physical destruction methods include the following:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Drilling holes directly into the device wipes data out on the
                  sections where there are holes. However, individuals can
                  recover data from the areas that are still intact.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Shredding includes the physical shredding of hard drives,
                  memory cards, CDs, DVDs, and other electronic storage devices.

                  Degaussing uses a high-powered magnet which destroys the data
                  on the device. This method effectively destroys large data
                  storage devices and renders the hard drive unusable. As
                  electronic technology changes, this method may become obsolete

                  Incinerating destroys data by burning the device. Most
                  companies do not have an incinerator on-site. Devices need to
                  be transported to a facility for incineration. Due to this,
                  devices can be lost or stolen in transit.

              <p>
                In addition to effectively destroying data on electronic
                devices, it is essential to follow best practices for electronic
                device disposal.

              <h5>Outsourcing</h5>
              <p>
                Outsourcing means using a third-party specializing in data
                destruction to complete the physical or recycling process. This
                option appeals to companies that do not have the staff or
                knowledge to complete the destruction themselves. Once a vendor
                has completed the task, they issue a certificate of
                destruction/recycling.
              </p>

              <p>
                The certificate of destruction serves as a statement of
                completed destruction of data on electronics, hard drives, or
                other devices. The certificate includes the client’s contact
                information, date of service, vendor company name, manifest,
                signature, method of destruction, and legal statement. However,
                exercise caution as the certificate does not indicate a level of
                training, auditing, or any other verification that a vendor is
                knowledgeable about data destruction.

                Data destruction makes data unreadable to an operating system or
                application. You should destroy data on devices no longer used
                by a company, unused or duplicated copies of data, or data
                that’s required to destroy. Data destruction methods include:

              <h4>User Habits</h4>
              You've got to involve your users when it comes to security. It's
              super important and might seem obvious, but it's usually
              overlooked. You can build the world's best security systems, but
              they won't protect you if the users are going to be practicing
              unsafe security. If a user writes their password on a Post-it
              Note, sticks it to their laptop, then leaves the laptop unlocked
              and unintended at a cafe, you could have a disaster on your hands,
              but making sure that your users take reasonable security
              precautions, takes effort, and can be really tricky, you have to
              make sure your user's habits and actions involve having clear and
              reasonable security policies, but there's more that you can do to
              help ensure that your users are diligent about maintaining
              security. Let's assume that your employees are acting with good
              intent and that leaks and disclosures are unintentional and mostly
              due to improper handling of sensitive data. Leaks and disclosures
              can be avoided by understanding what employees need to do to
              accomplish their jobs. You also need to make sure that they have
              the right tools to get their work done without compromising
              security. If an employee needs to share a confidential file with
              an external partner and it's too big to email, they may want to
              upload it to a third-party file-sharing website that they have a
              personal account with. This is risky business. You should never
              upload confidential information onto a third-party service that
              hasn't been evaluated by your company. If sharing big files with
              external parties is common behavior for your employees, it's best
              to find a solution that meets the needs of your users and the
              security guidelines. By providing a sanctioned and approved
              mechanism for this file sharing activity, users are less likely to
              expose the organization to unnecessary risk. We covered password
              security when we discussed password authentication earlier, but
              there's more to talk about when it comes to users and passwords. I
              hate to say it, but generally speaking, users can be lazy about
              security stuff. They don't like to memorize long complicated
              passwords, but this is super important to keeping your company
              safe. How do we resolve this conflict? If we require 20-character
              passwords that have to be changed every three months, our users
              will almost definitely write them down. This compromises the
              security that our complex password policy is supposed to provide.
              It's important to understand what threats password policies are
              supposed to protect against. That way, you can try to find a
              better balance between security and usability. Along and complex
              password requirement is designed to protect against brute force
              attacks, either against authentication systems or if a hashed
              password database is stolen. Since direct brute-force attacks
              against authentication infrastructure should be easily detected
              and blocked by intrusion prevention systems, they can be
              considered pretty low-risk, but the theft of a password database
              would be a super serious breach. We do have lots of additional
              layers of security in place to prevent a critical compromise like
              that from happening in the first place. The two attacks that
              complex passwords are primarily designed to protect against are
              fairly low-risk. Now, we can relax the password requirements a bit
              and not ask for overly long passwords. We can even adjust the
              mandatory password rotation time period. Password reuse is another
              common user behavior. People don't want a bunch of passwords to
              memorize. Lots of users find it easier to use the same password
              for both their personal email account and their work account, but
              this undermines the security of their work password. If an online
              service is compromised and the password database is leaked,
              they're in trouble. The passwords in that database will find their
              way into password files used for cracking passwords and brute
              force attacks. Once a password isn't a secret, it shouldn't be
              used anymore. The chances of a bad actor being able to use the
              password are too high. That's why it's important to make sure
              employees use new and unique passwords and don't reuse them from
              other services. It's also important to have a password change
              system check against old passwords. This will prevent users from
              changing their password back to a previously used potentially
              compromised password. A much greater risk in the workplace that
              users should be educated on is credential theft from phishing
              emails. Phishing emails are pretty effective. They take advantage
              of people's inclination to open emails without looking at them too
              closely. If an email that seems authentic actually leads to a fake
              login page, users can blindly enter their credentials into the
              fake site and disclose their credentials to an attacker. While
              having two-factor authentication helps protect against this type
              of attack, OTP based two-factor solutions would still provide
              usable credentials to an attacker, plus the attacker still has a
              password, which is really not good even in a two-factor
              environment. If someone enter their password into a phishing site
              or even suspects they did, it's important to change their password
              as soon as possible. If you can, your organization should try to
              detect these types of password disclosures using tools like
              Password Alert. This is a Chrome extension from Google that can
              detect when you enter your password into a site that's not a
              Google page. Being able to detect when a password is entered into
              a potentially untrustworthy site lets an organization detect
              potential phishing compromises, but you can also combat phishing
              attacks with good spam filtering combined with good user
              education. You can help influence good user behavior by offering
              security training.

              <h4>Third-Party Security</h4>

              Sometimes you need to rely on third party solutions or service
              providers because you might not be able to do everything in house.
              This is especially true if you work as an IT support specialist in
              a small shop. In some cases, you have to trust that third party
              with a lot of potentially sensitive data or access. So how do you
              make sure that you aren't opening yourself up to a ton of
              unnecessary risk? When you contract services from a third party,
              you're trusting them to protect your data and any credentials
              involved. If they have subpar security, you're undermining your
              security defenses by potentially opening a new avenue of attack.
              It's important to hire trustworthy and reputable vendors whenever
              you can. You also need to manage the engagements in a controlled
              way. This involves conducting a vendor risk review or security
              assessment. In typical vendor security assessments, you ask
              vendors to complete a questionnaire that covers different aspects
              of their security policies, procedures and defenses. The
              questionnaire is designed to determine whether or not they've
              implemented good security designs in their organization. For
              software services or hardware vendors, you might also ask to test
              the software hardware. That way you can evaluate it for potential
              security vulnerabilities or concerns before deciding to contract
              their services. It's important to understand how well protected
              your business partners are before deciding to work with them. If
              they have poor security practices, your organization's security
              could be at risk. If you contract services from a company that
              will be handling data on your behalf, the security of your data is
              in the hands of this third party. It's important to understand how
              safe your data will be with them. Sometimes, vendors will perform
              tasks for you so they have access to your network and systems. In
              these cases, it's also important to understand how well secured
              third party is, a compromise of their infrastructure could lead to
              a breach of your systems. While the questionnaire model is a quick
              way to assess a third party, it's not ideal. It depends on self
              reporting of practices which is pretty unreliable, without a way
              to verify or prove what's stated in the questionnaire. You have to
              trust that the company is answering honestly, why you'd hope that
              a company you're doing business with would be honest is best to
              verify. If you can, ask for a third- party security assessment
              report. Some of the information on the questionnaire can be
              verified like third party security audit results and penetration
              testing reports. In the case of third party software, you might be
              able to conduct some basic vulnerability assessments and tests to
              ensure the product has some reasonable security. There are lots of
              companies that will evaluate vendors for you for a price, but
              Google recently made their vendor security assessment
              questionnaires available for free. This is a great starting point
              to design your own vendor security assessment questionnaire. Or
              you can just use these as is if the third party service involves
              the installation of any infrastructure equipment on site. Pay
              close attention to how they're doing it, you have to make sure
              this equipment is managed in a way that doesn't negatively affect
              overall security. Let's say the vendor company requires remote
              access to the infrastructure device to perform maintenance. If
              that's the case, then make appropriate adjustments to firewall
              rules to restrict this access. That way, you'll make sure that it
              can't be used as an entry point into your network. Additional
              monitoring would also be recommended for this third party device,
              since it represents a new potential attack surface in your
              network. If the vendor lets you, evaluate the hardware in a lab
              environment, first, there you can run in depth vulnerability
              assessments and penetration testing of the hardware. And make sure
              there aren't any obvious vulnerabilities in the product. Report
              your findings to the vendor and ask that they address any issues
              you discover.

              <h4>Security Training</h4>

              The more trained up you and your colleagues are on security, the
              better. It's impossible to have good security practices at your
              company if employees and users haven't received good trainings and
              resources. This will boost a healthy company culture and overall
              attitude towards security. A working environment that encourages
              people to speak up when they feel something isn't right is
              critical. It encourages them to do the right thing. To help create
              this context, it's important for employees to have a way that they
              can ask questions when they come up. This could be a mailing list
              where users can ask questions about security concerns or to report
              things they suspect are security risks. Having the designated
              communication channel where people can feel comfortable asking
              questions and getting clear answers back is super important.
              Helping others keep security in mind will help decrease the
              security burdens you'll have as an IT support specialist. It will
              also make the overall security of the organization better.
              Creating a culture that makes security a priority isn't easy. You
              have to reinforce and reward behaviors that boost the security of
              your organization. Think of the small things we do every day when
              we use our computers, just entering your password to log in or
              locking your screen when you walk away from your computer is
              helpful. Hopefully, you're careful about entering your password on
              websites and check the address of the site you're authenticating
              against. If you aren't, try it out to avoid entering your password
              into a fake website. When you're working on your laptop in a
              public space like a library or coffee shop, do you lock your
              screen when you leave to use the restroom or get another caffeine
              fix? If not you absolutely should be. Hopefully, you aren't
              leaving your computer unattended in public in the first place.
              That's a really bad idea. These are the types of small things that
              security training should address. You also need to justify why
              these are good behaviors to adopt. In some cases, the company
              culture can turn screen locking into a sort of game. When
              colleagues forget to lock their screen, other team members can
              play harmless pranks on them. The last time I forgot to lock my
              computer, my colleague changed the default language to Turkish. It
              reminded me to always lock my screen because anyone with access to
              the machine can impersonate you and get access to any resources
              you're logged into. But building a culture that embraces security
              principles isn't always enough. There are some things that all
              employees should know. This is when an occasional mandatory
              security training course can help. This could be a short video or
              informational presentation followed by a quiz to see if your
              employees understood the key concepts covered in the training. The
              quiz can also increase the chances of information being retained.
              Making employees retake the training every once a year or so
              ensures that everyone is up to date on their training. You can
              also cover new concepts or updated policies when needed. This type
              of training should cover the most common attack types and how to
              avoid falling victim to them. This includes things like phishing
              emails and best practices around password use. These trainings
              often include scenarios that can help test the user's
              understanding of a particular topic. Training courses like these
              are the last in the line of defenses that you and your company
              need to have in place to make sure that you're as safe as possible
              for as long as possible.

              <h4>Incident Reporting and Analysis</h4>

              We try our best to protect our systems and networks, but it's
              pretty likely that some sort of incident will happen. This could
              be anything from a full system compromise and data theft to
              someone accidentally leaking a memo. Regardless of the nature of
              the incident, proper incident handling is important to
              understanding what exactly happened and how it happened and how to
              avoid it from happening again. The very first step of handling an
              incident is detected in the first place. Hopefully, our intrusion
              detection systems caught the telltale signs of an ongoing attack
              and alerted us to the threat, incidents can be brought to your
              attention in other ways too. Riproduci il video a partire da ::39

              suspicious and reported it to the security team for investigation
              or maybe they leaked information that ended up in the news.
              However you found out about the incident, the next step is to
              analyze it and determine the effects and scope of damage. Was it a
              data leak or information disclosure? If so, what information got
              out? How bad is it, where systems compromised? What systems and
              what level of access did they manage to get? Is it a malware
              infection? What systems were infected? Some attacks are really
              obvious with very clear signs of an intrusion, like a defaced web
              page or unusual processes consuming all resources in the system.
              Others may be way more subtle and almost impossible to detect.

              why having good monitoring in place is so important along with
              understanding your baseline. Once you figure out what normal
              traffic looks like on your network and what services you expect to
              see, outliers will be easier to detect. This is important because
              every false lead that the incident response team has to
              investigate means time and resources wasted. This has the
              potential to allow real intrusions to go undetected and
              uninvestigated longer. During detection and scoping correlating
              data from different systems can reveal a much bigger picture of
              what's happened. It might show how an intruder gained access. For
              example, you could see a connection event logged by the firewall
              from a suspicious IP address. Searching for other events related
              to this IP address may reveal login attempts in the authentication
              logs for a system. This would provide insight into where the
              attacker is coming from and what they attempted to do on the
              network. The authentication logs would also indicate whether or
              not they were able to successfully log into an account. If so,
              that's let you know what account is compromised. Once the scope of
              the incident is determined, the next step is containment. You need
              to contain the breach to prevent further damage for system
              compromises and malware infection. This is a pretty time sensitive
              step. You don't want the malware or attacker to use one
              compromised machine to pivot to other machines inside your
              network. This could broaden the incident scope and cause even more
              damage. Containment strategies will vary depending on the nature
              of the incident. If an account was compromised, change the
              password immediately. If the owner is unable to change the
              password right away, then lock the account, also revoke any long
              live authentication tokens. Since the attacker may have one of
              those two. If it's a malware infection, can our anti malware
              software quarantine or remove the infection. If not the infected
              machine needs to be removed from the network as soon as possible
              to prevent lateral movement around the network, to do this, you
              can adjust network based firewall rules to effectively quarantine
              the machine. You can also move the machine to a separate V Land
              used for security quarantining purposes. This would be a V-land
              with strict restrictions and filtering applied to prevent further
              infection of other systems and networks.
              <img src="image/5/quarantine-machine.jpeg" alt="" />
              It's important during this phase that efforts are made to avoid
              the destruction of any logs or forensic evidence. Attackers will
              usually try to cover their tracks by modifying logs and deleting
              files, especially when they suspect they've been caught. They'll
              take measures to make sure they keep their access to compromised
              systems. This could involve installing a backdoor or some kind of
              remote access malware. Another step to watch out for is creating a
              new user account that they can use to authenticate with in the
              future with effective logging, configurations and systems in
              place. These activities would show up in audit logs. So this type
              of access should be detected during an incident investigation.
              Then actions can be taken to remove access. I hope I'm not scaring
              you with all these scenarios, but it's better to be safe than
              sorry. Another part of incident analysis is determining severity,
              impact and recovery ability of the incident,. Severity includes
              factors like what and how many systems were compromised and how
              the breach affects business functions. An incident that's
              compromised a bunch of machines in the network would be more
              severe than one where a single web server was hacked. For example,
              you can imagine that the effort required to fix a large scale
              compromise would negatively affect the ability to do normal work.
              So the impact of an incident is also an important issue to
              consider if the organization only had one web server and it was
              compromised, it might be considered a much higher severity breach.
              It would probably have a direct externally visible impact on the
              business. Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data
              from a computer. It's also a very important concern when a
              security incident happens, hackers may try to steal data for a
              number of reasons. They may want to steal account information to
              provide access later. They may target business data to publish
              online to cause financial loss or damage to the organization's
              reputation. In some cases, the attacker may just want to cause
              damage and destruction which might involve the leading or
              corrupting data. What actions have been taken will affect the
              recovery ability of the incident. The recovery ability is how
              complicated and time consuming the recovery effort will be. An
              incident that can be recovered with a simple restoration from
              backup by following documented procedures would be considered
              easily recovered from. But an incident where an attacker deleted
              large amounts of customer information and wrecked havoc across
              lots of critical infrastructure systems would be way more
              difficult to recover from. It might not be possible to recover
              from it at all. In some cases, depending on backup systems and
              configurations, some data may be lost forever and can't be
              restored. Backups won't contain any changes or new data that were
              made after the last backup run.

              <h4>Incident Response</h4>
              <p>
                When you’ve had a data breach, you may need forensic analysis to
                analyze the attack. This analysis usually involves extensive
                evidence gathering. This reading covers some considerations for
                protecting the integrity of your forensic evidence and avoiding
                complications or issues related to how you handle evidence.
              </p>

              <h5>Regulated data</h5>

              <p>
                It’s important to consider the type of data involved in an
                incident. Many types of data are subject to government
                regulations that require you to take extra care when handling
                it. Here are some examples you’re likely to encounter as an IT
                support specialist.

                  commercial and dual-use goods, software, and technology.
                  Dual-use goods are items that can be used both for civilian
                  and military applications. These goods are heavily regulated
                  because they can be classified for civilian use and then
                  transformed for military purposes.

              </ol>
              <h5>Digital rights management (DRM)</h5>
              <p>
                Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies can help ensure
                data regulations compliance. DRM technology comes in the form of
                either software or hardware solutions. Both options allow
                content creators to prevent deliberate piracy and unauthorized
                usage. DRM often involves using codes that prohibit content
                copying or limit the number of devices that can access a
                product. Content creators can also use DRM applications to
                restrict what users can do with their material. They can encrypt
                digital media so only someone with the decryption key can access
                it. This gives content creators and copyright holders a way to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Restrict users from editing, saving, sharing, printing, or
                  taking screenshots of content or products
                </li>

                <li>
                  Set expiration dates on media to prevent access beyond that
                  date or limit the number of times users can access the media
                </li>

                <li>
                  Limit access to specific devices, Internet Protocol (IP)
                  addresses, or locations, such as limiting content to people in
                  a specific country
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Organizations can use these DRM capabilities to protect
                sensitive data. DRM enables organizations to track who has
                viewed files, control access, and manage how people use the
                files. It also prevents files from being altered, duplicated,
                saved, or printed. DRM can help organizations comply with data
                protection regulations.
              </p>

              <h5>End User Licensing Agreement (EULA)</h5>
              <p>
                End User Licensing Agreements (EULAs) are similar to DRM in
                specifying certain rights and restrictions that apply to the
                software. You often encounter EULA statements when installing a
                software package, accessing a website, sharing a file, or
                downloading content. A EULA is usually considered a legally
                binding agreement between the owner of a product (e.g., a
                software publisher) and the product's end-user. The EULA
                specifies the rights and restrictions that apply to the
                software, and it’s usually presented to users during
                installation or setup of the software. You can’t complete an
                installation (or access, share, or download data) until you
                agree to the terms written in the EULA statement.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unlike DRM restrictions, EULAs are only valid if you agree to it
                (i.e., you check a box or click the ‘I Agree’ button). DRM
                restrictions don’t require your agreement—or rely on you to keep
                that agreement. DRMs are built into the product they protect,
                making it easier for content creators to ensure users do not
                violate restrictions.
              </p>

              <h5>Chain of custody</h5>
              <p>
                “Chain of custody” refers to a process that tracks evidence
                movement through its collection, safeguarding, and analysis
                lifecycle. Maintaining the chain of custody makes it difficult
                for someone to argue that the evidence was tampered with or
                mishandled. Your chain of custody documentation should answer
                the following questions. Documentation for these questions must
                be maintained and filed in a secure location for current and
                future reference.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Who collected the evidence? Evidence can include the afflicted
                  or used devices, media, and associated peripherals.
                </li>

                <li>
                  How was the evidence collected, and where was it located?
                </li>

                <li>Who seized and possessed the evidence?</li>

                <li>
                  How was the evidence stored and protected in storage? The
                  procedures involved in storing and protecting evidence are
                  called evidence-custodian procedures.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Who took the evidence out of storage and why? Ongoing
                  documentation of the names of individuals who check out
                  evidence and why must be kept.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                When a data breach occurs, forensic analysis usually involves
                taking an image of the disk. This makes a virtual copy of the
                hard drive. The copy lets an investigator analyze the disk’s
                contents without modifying or altering the original files. An
                alteration compromises the integrity of the evidence. This kind
                of compromised integrity is what you want to avoid when
                performing forensic investigations.
              </p>

              <h5>Key takeaways:</h5>
              <p>
                Incident handling requires careful attention and documentation
                during an incident investigation's analysis and response phases.

                <li>
                  Be familiar with what types of regulated data may be on your
                  systems and ensure proper procedures are in place to ensure

              <h4>Incident Response and Recovery</h4>
              Once the threat has been detected and contained, it has to be
              removed or remediated. When it comes to malware infection, this
              means removing the malware from affected systems. But in some
              cases, this may not be possible, so the affected systems have to
              be restored to a known good configuration. This can be done by
              rebuilding the machine or restoring from backup. Take care when
              removing malware from systems, because some malware is designed to
              be very persistent, which means it's resistant to being removed.
              But before we can start the recovery, we have to contain the
              incident. This might involve shutting down affected systems to
              prevent further damage or spread of an infection. On the flip side
              of that, affected systems may just have network access removed to
              cut off any communication with the compromised system. Again, the
              motivating factor here would be to prevent the spread of any
              infection or to remove remote access to the system. The
              containment strategy varies depending on the nature of the
              affected system. Let's say a critical piece of networking
              infrastructure was compromised. A quick shutdown may not work
              since it would impact other business operations. On top of that,
              removing networking access might trigger fail safes and attack
              software or malware. Let's say a piece of malware is designed to
              periodically check into a command and control server. Severing
              network communications with the infected host might cause the
              malware to trigger a self-destruct function in an attempt to
              destroy evidence. Forensic analysis may need to be done to analyze
              the attack. This is especially true when it comes to a malware
              infection. In the case of forensic analysis, affected machines
              might be investigated very closely to determine exactly what the
              attacker did. This is usually done by taking an image of the disk,
              essentially making a virtual copy of the hard drive. This lets the
              investigator analyze the contents of the disk without the risk of
              modifying or altering the original files. If that happened, it
              would compromise the integrity of any forensic evidence. Usually
              evidence gathering is also part of the incident response process.
              This provides evidenced to law enforcement if the organization
              wants to pursue legal action against the attackers. Forensic
              evidence is super useful for providing details of the attack to
              the security community. It allows other security teams to be aware
              of new threats and lets them better defend themselves. It's also
              very important that you get members from your legal team involved
              in any incident handling plans. Because an incident can have legal
              implications for the company, a lawyer should be available to
              consult and advise on the legal aspects of the investigation. It's
              crucial in order to avoid complications or issues of liability.
              Members of the public relations team should also get involved
              since these incidents can have an impact on a company's
              reputation. There's another part of the cleanup and recovery phase
              I should call out. We'll need to use information from the analysis
              to prevent any further intrusions or infections. First, we
              determine the entry point to figure out how the attacker got in or
              what vulnerability the malware exploited. This needs to be done at
              the same time as the cleanup. If you remove the malware infection
              without also addressing the underlying vulnerability, systems
              could become re-infected right after you clean them up.
              Postmortems can be a great way to document incidents. The
              learnings from post-mortems can be used to prevent those incidents
              from happening again. If a critical system has been compromised,
              remediation can be complicated because of downtime during
              remediation and recovery, logs have to be audited to determine
              exactly what the attacker did while they had access to the system.
              They'll also tell you what data the attacker accessed. Systems
              must be scrutinized to ensure no back doors have been installed or
              malware planted on the system. Depending on the severity of the
              compromise or infection, it might be necessary to rebuild the
              system from the ground up. Clean up will typically involve
              restoring from a backup point to a known good configuration.
              Infected or corrupted system files can be restored from known good
              copies. Sometimes cleanup can be very simple and quick. I hope
              that's what you find more often than not. If a website was
              defaced, the attacker may have simply uploaded their defaced HTML
              file and pointed the web server at the new file. A configuration
              file change and deletion of the attackers HTML file would undo
              those changes. Even so, efforts needs to be made to determine how
              the attacker got access. That vulnerability should be closed to
              prevent any future attacks. When all traces of the attack have
              been removed and discovered and the known vulnerabilities have
              been closed, you can move on to the last step. That's when systems
              need to be thoroughly tested to make sure proper functionality has
              been restored. Usually, affected systems would also remain under
              close watch, sometimes with additional detailed monitoring and
              logging enabled. This is to watch for any additional signs of an
              intrusion in case something was missed during the cleanup. It's
              also possible that the attacker will attempt to attack the same
              target again. There's a very high chance that they use the same or
              similar attack methodology on other targets in your network. It's
              important to incorporate the lessons you've learned from any
              incident into your overall security defenses. Update firewall
              rules and ACLs if an exposure was discovered in the course of the
              investigation. Create new definitions and rules for intrusion
              detection systems that can watch for the signs of the same attack
              again. Stay vigilant and prepared to protect your system from
              attacks. Remember that at some point, some security breach will
              happen, just they come and execute your plan to counter attack the
              breach.

              <h4>Mobile Security and Privacy</h4>

              Keeping mobile devices secure is super important. Think about the
              kind of data that a mobile device can have email, personal files,
              photos, health data, location data and so on. Mobile devices
              travel with us and they aren't protected by the same level of
              physical security as a server in a data center. Mobile devices are
              easily misplaced or stolen. So we need to be sure to secure these
              devices, as we go through this video, remember that many of the
              settings that we will discuss can be automatically configured or
              required by policy using mobile device management. One of the most
              basic protections you can enable on a smartphone or tablet is a
              screen lock. A screen lock presents some kind of challenge that
              you have to respond to, in order to unlock the device. You might
              enter a pin or password, you might draw a pattern on screen or you
              might use biometric data like a fingerprint or even your face to
              unlock the device. No protection is perfect. So we should use
              defense in depth to protect the data on your mobile devices. What
              if someone steals the device and reboots it or takes it apart to
              get the storage directly? To help protect against this, enable
              storage encryption on your mobile devices. On some devices, this
              is done by default, but if it isn't you should enable that
              feature. We've talked a little bit about protecting your device
              from an outside attacker. But what about protecting the data on
              your device from an app that's installed on your device? End users
              should be able to control which apps on their mobile device have
              access to what data. Let's look at how you can see which apps are
              using or have access to use specific types of private data on your
              device. Mobile operating systems have defined permissions that
              control which app has access to which systems or data. Each OS has
              a list of permissions and the app requests access to the specific
              permissions that it needs. Mobile apps will request permission
              either when they are first installed or when they first try to use
              the permission. At times an end user might deny an app access to a
              permission that it needs, making that app unable to function
              properly. It might be up to you to help them troubleshoot app
              permissions. For example, one permission controls access to
              information about the devices location. A mobile device can use
              its GPS, cellular networking and Wi-Fi networking to determine the
              location of the device. Determining the devices location uses a
              lot of battery power, and it's also very sensitive from a privacy
              point of view, still knowing the location of the device is
              critical for some apps. For example, obviously the app that you
              use for mapping and navigation needs to know where the device is.
              You can turn a mobile devices location services on and off. You
              can also use the app permission settings on your device to control
              which apps have access to location services when they are on.
              Let's take a look, here's how to do it in android. Riproduci il
              video a partire da :3: e segui la trascrizione3:00 Here's a list
              of all the permissions that apps can request and if I select one,
              I can see and control which apps have access to my device's
              location. Riproduci il video a partire da :3:9 e segui la
              trascrizione3:09 I can do the same thing in IOS and with other
              permissions, for example, let's check which apps have access to
              record sounds through the devices, microphone. So here I have an
              iPhone, from the privacy setting, I can view all of the different
              categories of private data and control which apps have access to
              which data. If I select one, I can see and control which apps have
              access to my devices, microphone. Android and IOS Use different
              names for the type of permissions and private data that they can
              grant to apps. But the basics are the same.

              <h4>Bring Your Own Device</h4>
              <p>
                In this reading, you will learn about a business practice called
                “bring your own device” (BYOD), as well as the security risks
                related to BYOD policies and how to mitigate these risks.
                Organizations can reduce IT costs by limiting the number of
                company-owned mobile devices issued to employees. Instead,
                businesses are passing on the costs of mobile devices and
                cellular services to employees by allowing employees to bring
                their own devices for business use.
              </p>

              <h5>Bring your own device (BYOD)</h5>
              <p>
                Traditionally, IT departments would provide mobile devices to
                employees for business use. This gave the IT staff control over
                the security of those devices. Today, an increasing number of
                companies permit employees to bring their own devices to work.
                This trend started with employees requesting permission to carry
                a single smartphone rather than carrying one phone for work and
                one for personal use. Organizations noticed the cost savings
                gained by allowing their employees to select their personal
                smartphones as the single device. By using smartphones with dual
                SIM card slots or phone apps like Google Voice, users can
                configure multiple phone lines on a single smartphone. However,
                BYODs can become dangerous security threats to companies’ data
                and networks. IT departments do not have the same level of
                control over the security of BYOD devices as they would with
                company-owned devices.
              </p>

              <h5>BYOD Threats</h5>
              <p>
                Some of the potential threats BYODs pose to company networks,
                resources, and data include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Loss or theft could result in an organization’s data being
                  stolen or the lost device being used to gain unauthorized
                  access to a company’s network.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Data loss, including:

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Data leakage losses can happen when a computing device is
                      lost or compromised; when an employee accidentally saves
                      or sends confidential information to the wrong
                      destination; when a disgruntled employee exposes data
                      maliciously; or when viruses, malware, phishing attacks,
                      etc. penetrate organizations’ networks.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Data portability losses can occur when former employees
                      take company data with them on their BYOD when they resign
                      or are fired by the organization.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Security vulnerabilities are any type of weakness in the
                  security of a device or network that provides access for a
                  threat to penetrate the system.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Meddler in the middle attacks (MITM) occur when an attacker
                  monitors the data transfers between two sources with the
                  intent to copy and/or interfere with that information. One of
                  the most common opportunities for an MITM attack arises when a
                  mobile device accesses important information through a public
                  Wi-Fi connection, such as at a hotel or restaurant.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Malware is malicious software that can be used to steal,
                  modify, or delete data. It can also be used to gain
                  unauthorized access to a device or network.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Jailbreaking happens when a manufacturer’s protective
                  restrictions are removed on a mobile device. Without these
                  restrictions, a device becomes vulnerable to the risk of the
                  user unknowingly installing malicious software.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Solutions</h5>
              <p>
                To mitigate these threats, organizations and their IT
                departments should design security policies for BYOD use inside
                company networks. Some preventative steps could include:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Develop a bring your own device (BYOD) policy: IT departments
                  and organizations can create written policies that detail the
                  minimum technology requirements for permitted BYODs, provide
                  instructions for employees on how to properly secure their
                  devices, and list the rules for safe data access and storage.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Use Mobile Device Management (MDM) software: MDM software can
                  be used to enforce BYOD policy requirements for mobile devices
                  to help secure company data and networks. IT departments can
                  use MDM software to:
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                      Automatically install apps and updates, including
                      antivirus and anti-malware software
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Configure secure connections to an organization’s wireless
                      networks
                    </li>

                    <li>Encrypt storage on devices</li>

                    <li>Require a lock screen and password</li>

                    <li>Remote wipe a mobile device that is lost or stolen</li>

                    <li>Block the execution of certain apps</li>

                    <li>Meet compliance standards</li>

                    <li>
                      Prevent data being shared or stored in unauthorized
                      locations
                    </li>

                    <li>Manage devices remotely</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use an Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM) system: MDM policies
                  are specific to mobile operating systems. In order to
                  distribute MDM policies across Android, iOS, and other mobile
                  operating systems, the BYODs can be enrolled through an
                  Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) system.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Require the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA): Users
                  can be authenticated by presenting more than one method of
                  identification. Some common identification factors include:
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>Something you know: a password or pin number</li>

                    <li>
                      Something you have: a physical token, like an ATM or bank
                      card, USB device, key fob, or OTP (one-time password)
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Something you are: biometric data, like a fingerprint,
                      voice signature, facial recognition, or retina scan
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Somewhere you are: location-dependent access, like a
                      Global Positioning System (GPS) location
                    </li>

                    <li>
                      Something you do: gestures, like swipe patterns; Turing
                      tests, like CAPTCHA; or normal patterns of behavior, like
                      regular login and logout times
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Set an acceptable use policy (AUP): Organizations could create
                  policies that set a code of conduct for use of the companies’
                  data, systems, network, and other resources.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Use non-disclosure agreements (NDA): Organizations can create
                  legally binding contracts with employees to assert the
                  confidentiality and security policies for the companies’ data
                  and intellectual property.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Restrict data access: IT departments should protect company
                  data by limiting access to only those employees who need
                  access to perform their jobs.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Educate staff about data security: Organizations can provide
                  training manuals and seminars to inform employees about
                  network security risks and to instruct on how to secure their
                  BYODs.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Back up device data: IT departments need to create backup
                  policies for all important data. This should include a
                  schedule for frequency of backups, storage space for the
                  back-up copies, how long back-ups should be stored, and
                  disaster recovery plans.

                  Data leakage prevention (DLP): IT departments can implement
                  DLP software solutions to help manage and protect confidential
                  information.

              <h5>Key takeaways</h5>
              <p>
                Organizations are taking advantage of the cost savings created
                by adopting “bring your own device” (BYOD) policies for
                employees. However, permitting employees to connect personal
                mobile devices to company networks introduces multiple security
                threats. There are a variety of security measures that IT
                departments can implement to protect organizations’ information
                systems:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Develop BYOD policies</li>

                <li>Enforce BYOD policies with MDM software</li>

                <li>
                  Distribute MDM settings to multiple OSes through EMM systems
                </li>

                <li>Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)</li>

                <li>
                  Create acceptable use policies for company data and resources
                </li>

                <li>Require employees to sign NDAs</li>

                <li>Limit who can access data</li>

                <li>Train employees on data security</li>

                <li>Back up data regularly</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Final Project - Sample Submission</h4>
              <h6>Authentication</h6>
              <p>
                Authentication will be handled centrally by an LDAP server and
                will incorporate One-Time Password generators as a 2nd factor
                for authentication.
              </p>

              <h6>External Website</h6>
              <p>
                The customer-facing website will be served via HTTPS, since it
                will be serving an e-commerce site permitting visitors to browse
                and purchase products, as well as create and log into accounts.
                This website would be publically accessible.
              </p>

              <h6>Internal Website</h6>
              <p>
                The internal employee website will also be served over HTTPS, as
                it will require authentication for employees to access. It will
                also only be accessible from the internal company network and
                only with an authenticated account.
              </p>

              <h6>Remote Access</h6>
              <p>
                Since engineers require remote access to internal websites, as
                well as remote command line access to workstations, a
                network-level VPN solution will be needed, like OpenVPN. To make
                internal website access easier, a reverse proxy is recommended,
                in addition to VPN. Both of these would rely on the LDAP server
                that was previously mentioned for authentication and
                authorization.
              </p>

              <h6>Firewall</h6>
              <p>
                A network-based firewall appliance would be required. It would
                include rules to permit traffic for various services, starting
                with an implicit deny rule, then selectively opening ports.
                Rules will also be needed to allow public access to the external
                website, and to permit traffic to the reverse proxy server and
                the VPN server.
              </p>

              <h6>Wireless</h6>
              <p>
                For wireless security, 802.1X with EAP-TLS should be used. This
                would require the use of client certificates, which can also be
                used to authenticate other services, like VPN, reverse proxy,
                and internal website authentication. 802.1X is more secure and
                more easily managed as the company grows, making it a better
                choice than WPA2.
              </p>

              <h6>VLANs</h6>
              <p>
                Incorporating VLANs into the network structure is recommended as
                a form of network segmentation; it will make controlling access
                to various services easier to manage. VLANs can be created for
                broad roles or functions for devices and services. An
                engineering VLAN can be used to place all engineering
                workstations and engineering services on. An Infrastructure VLAN
                can be used for all infrastructure devices, like wireless APs,
                network devices, and critical servers like authentication. A
                Sales VLAN can be used for non-engineering machines, and a Guest
                VLAN would be useful for other devices that don't fit the other
                VLAN assignments.
              </p>

              <h6>Laptop Security</h6>
              <p>
                As the company handles payment information and user data,
                privacy is a big concern. Laptops should have full disk
                encryption (FDE) as a requirement, to protect against
                unauthorized data access if a device is lost or stolen.
                Antivirus software is also strongly advised to avoid infections
                from common malware. To protect against more uncommon attacks
                and unknown threats, binary whitelisting software is
                recommended, in addition to antivirus software.
              </p>

              Application Policy
              <p>
                To further enhance the security of client machines, an
                application policy should be in place to restrict the
                installation of third-party software to only applications that
                are related to work functions. Specifically, risky and legally
                questionable application categories should be explicitly banned.
                This would include things like pirated software, license key
                generators, and cracked software.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition to policies that restrict some forms of software, a
                policy should also be included to require the timely
                installation of software patches. “Timely” in this case will be
                defined as 30 days from the wide availability of the patch.
              </p>

              User Data Privacy Policy
              <p>
                As the company takes user privacy very seriously, some strong
                policies around accessing user data are a critical requirement.
                User data must only be accessed for specific work purposes,
                related to a particular task or project. Requests must be made
                for specific pieces of data, rather than overly broad,
                exploratory requests. Requests must be reviewed and approved
                before access is granted. Only after review and approval will an
                individual be granted access to the specific user data
                requested. Access requests to user data should also have an end
                date.
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition to accessing user data, policies regarding the
                handling and storage of user data are also important to have
                defined. These will help prevent user data from being lost and
                falling into the wrong hands. User data should not be permitted
                on portable storage devices, like USB keys or external hard
                drives. If an exception is necessary, an encrypted portable hard
                drive should be used to transport user data. User data at rest
                should always be contained on encrypted media to protect it from
                unauthorized access.
              </p>

              <h6>Security Policy</h6>
              <p>
                To ensure that strong and secure passwords are used, the
                password policy below should be enforced:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Password must have a minimum length of 8 characters</li>

                <li>
                  Password must include a minimum of one special character or
                  punctuation
                </li>

                <li>Password must be changed once every 12 months</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                In addition to these password requirements, a mandatory security
                training must be completed by every employee once every year.
                This should cover common security-related scenarios, like how to
                avoid falling victim to phishing attacks, good practices for
                keeping your laptop safe, and new threats that have emerged
                since the last time the course was taken.
              </p>

              <h6>Intrusion Detection or Prevention Systems</h6>
              <p>
                A Network Intrusion Detection System is recommended to watch
                network activity for signs of an attack or malware infection.
                This would allow for good monitoring capabilities without
                inconveniencing users of the network. A Network Intrusion
                Prevention System (NIPS) is recommended for the network where
                the servers containing user data are located; it contains much
                more valuable data, which is more likely to be targeted in an
                attack. In addition to Network Intrusion Prevention, Host-based
                Intrusion Detection (HIDS) software is also recommended to be
                installed on these servers to enhance monitoring of these
                important systems.
